All opinons here are my own, not my employer or any other organization cited here. 

## Career
I started with a 2 year stint at [HP](https://www.hp.com) as a software developer, got laid off, and have worked at [Red Hat, Inc.](https://wwww.redhat.com) ever since. It's been good, I'm not actively looking for a new job. [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) continues to behave like an ally too, which is encouraging.

It's been about 11 years now; the first few years I was a [release engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_engineering), eventually became a technical lead for the team, then the lead for a team of teams. A few years ago I branched out into more "[low code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform)" roles: program manager, architect, business analyst, and later portfolio management.

Today I'm a Senior Principal Software Engineer. I work with a (mostly) hand-picked team of directors, architects, and portfolio managers to manage the direction of a 400+ person department. The Enterprise Experience and Delivery (EXD) department is responsible for a few things:
* maintaining and extending [Red Hat's Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com)
* maintaining and building out the services Engineering uses to manufacture and deliver software products (build systems, delivery systems, etc)
* a deployment of Open Hybrid Cloud infrastructure available to host any tools and services Engineering needs to do their job

In many ways, we're a branch of IT that provides both developer playgrounds and mission critical services. My job experience has made me a swiss-army knife in this industry and I continue to drive Red Hat's use of software technology, manufacturing process, and portfolio management every day. 

## Personal Life
I have a [wife](https://www.anselm.edu/faculty-directory/elizabeth-greguske) with 2 kids. A few nights out of the week I'm usually practicing on the drum kit, playing D&D, playing video games with friends online, or painting miniatures. Prior to raising kids I also played Ultimate (frisbee) and paintball. 

I have traveled to Europe many times for fun and business. I've been to England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Israel. Prior to the pandemic, I would be at a loud metal concert once a quarter. The only fest I've been to is [Aftershock](https://aftershockfestival.com/), and that was a blast.

## Bucket List
* Win a CTF competition (in Computer Security)
* Learn a 2nd language
* Run a 1-20 level D&D campaign
* Retire while I am still capable of traveling around the world
* Raise these kids to be productive members of human society
