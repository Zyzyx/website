I accepted an invite to G+ today. We'll see if I regret this later.

So far it seems like something I can get into casually. Sparks are not very useful yet though, they appear to be stylized google searches of stuff you like. If I could integrate RSS feeds or something into my "stream" that'd be much more useful.

Let me know if any of you want an invite.
