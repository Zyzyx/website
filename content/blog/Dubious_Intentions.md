Been playing Dragon Age a lot lately with a 2nd character: a dwarf rogue commoner. I'm also exploring the shadier quests and dialogue options, and sometimes the game lets me take certain "liberties" that probably wouldn't fly in real life. Here begins a catalogue of such actions.

* The guardsmen of a the local garrison need a morale boost before a fight with the undead. I suggested handing out a bunch of silver holy symbols with no magical power at all... but said that they did. The priest in my party was not a fan of this plan (-8 approval rating), so immediately after committing this heresy, I picked some flowers and gave them to her (+10 approval rating).
* I stopped at the Chantry (church) to turn in a quest in Denerim. It was my good deed for the day: cleaned out some riff-raff in town. I then did an about face and dumped a few bodies into the Chantry's well from a deal that went bad in the alleys just a few minutes ago in front of the quest turn-in NPC.
* Insulted and threatened a high priestess when she refused to release a murderer that I wanted to join my party. A party mate wasn't a fan of that idea so I walked outside of the church, changed party members, walked back inside, and threatened her some more until she gave up the key. Bought the previous guy an engraved bowl to smooth things over, then traded his ass for the murderer.
* Some high official didn't like my shenanigans from earlier in the game, so he publicly challenged me to a 1-on-1 duel. I obliged, and immediately told the rest of my party to kick his ass when the duel started. They completed this gusto. A child messenger observed this whole affair, and when I asked him for work, he said I looked like "an honest type".

I'm sure there's more to come.
