Not long ago Mogg mentioned listening to Apocalyptica, a band consisting of a classical string instruments (bass, cello) plus drums whose music is covers of metal classics and much of their own material. This group came up on Pandora a few times for me as well, and I really enjoyed them, so finally I started listening more seriously.

One of the first pieces I recognized was a cover of Nothing Else Matters by Metallica; one I think we're all familiar with. I wasn't ready for the memories that those melodies were going to bring back. Metallica was the band that got me into metal, and the self-titled album (aka the Black Album) was the first one I purchased with my own money. I remember constantly listening to it on bus rides to and from school, going back to it when moving stuff into Mom's house in 6th grade, rides from awful nights at Red Lobster, and lastly after graduating high school.

I can't explain why I like the song so much, or why I find it so moving. It's not the lyrics; indeed I can scarcely remember them even now while I listen to the cover. But the melody, especially the solo, has always been very powerful.

So tonight here's to how things were, how things have changed, and most importantly, how things will change.
