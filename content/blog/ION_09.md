Attended the Invasion of Normandy event at skirmish last weekend. Definitely an event I'll remember for some time.

**Friday**

To get warmed up we started with a free game that went from 6-9pm. Imagine two large forts on opposite ends of a course that is shaped like a large U (but rather than being a 180 degree U it was more like 120). Between the forts are small dinky towns and a lot of woods, and scattered about are big white jugs. The objective was to gather up as many jugs as you could and put them in your fort.

One highlight for me was right at the beginning where the 3 of us participated in a assaulting a town and taking the land from the enemy. Village-like scenarios are where my gun excels: it is medium range and an automatic if I want it to be. Took out several aggressors there. Another highlight was right at the end, where I participated in a charge that ended with us storming the enemy fort and stealing their jugs.

Towards the middle and end of the scenario though things got frustrating because it was raining. Goggles became Foggles, and I really couldn't see anything to be useful. We bailed after the fort was taking, which was around 8pm.

**Saturday**

At noon the scenario began, and we were positioned up against the front lines on the far left side of the beach from the German perspective. So much paint in the air. Refs with riot shields to protect themselves. Countless smoke grenades thrown at us by the allies. Golf carts turned into tanks. Paint-rocket launchers. The first two hours were the most intense, and I think the 3 of us consumed 2 entire cases of paint (4,000 rounds) in that phase.

After a few reloads and refuels, we got involved with capturing objectives for points. Us and about 20 others assisted with captures and defensives of props to gain points for our team. It was a little more sane since the fights involved less than 40 people.

Saturday was the more fun, we played from noon to 8ish, and were very sore by the end. We got a good sampling of what the scenario had to offer too: the craziness of the front lines, and the getting involved with missions and objectives for specific companies of troops.

Sunday
Arrived around 10 and played for about 2 hours to shoot off the rest of our paint. We fought on the front lines a bit (now in the woods and not the beach) and circled around back to test other Allied defenses. We didn't do anything particularly game-changing, but it was a good "last hurrah". We didn't stick around for the award ceremony or anything, but it was clear from our success on Saturday and the ground the Allies had not taken that the Germans won the scenario.

Definitely a lot of fun, and will consider it again next year.
