This morning I reached Earthen Peak.

I have been deliberately not reading major spoilers or walkthroughs for the game, so I have no idea how far along I am. I have 2 Big Souls (I forget what they're really called) so far, one from The Lost Sinner, and one from The Rotten. I'm playing a lightly-equipped sword-and-shield character right now: no spells, heavy on the dexterity stat. I think I'm about Soul Level 80.

So far, I have enjoyed this game more than the original; I think it is better designed and delivers exactly what I wanted in an action video game. I think the layout of the world is a little better, and the item placement is better designed too. In the first game, it was easy to head to the Crypts first, and get smashed over and over again because you are too low level. You could continue down the Demon Ruins after Quelaag and get spanked by the Tauras Demons too. Fans may argue that this is just the difficulty of the game being exposed, you're supposed to figure out that you're under-leveled, but I actually think that is poor design. In DS2 you're led to a starting area that is meant for you, and then the world progressively opens up. After clearing several areas I went to the Gutter after buying the Cat Ring, and I'm pretty sure I should have done Huntsmen's Copse instead, because I really struggled in the Gutter and rolled through the Copse. It was the wrong decision, but I still made it through to the Rotten eventually. There I learned I was under-leveled for that boss. Conveniently, there was a bonfire near it that I could teleport from and return later.

I guess what I'm trying to say about the level design in DS2 is that much harder areas are not deliberately put right next to easy areas. You cannot get to the Gutter until you spend 13,000 souls on a ring, you cannot get to the Copse until you talk to an NPC in the Towers, and you're lead to the Forest of Giants first once you reach Majula, the game's hub. DS1 had the Crypts and New Londo right next to Firelink shrine, Demon Ruins right after Blighttown, and the Tomb of Giants right after Pinwheel, arguably the easiest boss in the game.

The item placement is better too. DS1 had a couple items you could sprint to from the beginning of the game that were the best you could get for a particular build. The best sorceror armor in the game is right by the Ceaseless Discharge, which is near the halfway point of the game, unless you sprint to it after doing Blighttown (which is the end of the first quarter I would say). This time around it seems like upgrading is less important, because finding titanite is more difficult. I have not found an NPC that sells an infinite amount of them yet.

I made one observation about design early in the game too. Once you get to Heide's Towers (I forget if that is the exact name) which feature oversized, slow-moving knights. A popular strategy with these things is to roll behind them and strike their back while it is exposed. One of the area bosses is also vulnerable to this tactic, and by the time you move on toward No-man's Wharf, you should have this approach mastered. As you work your way down a tower to an underground cave, you find the same enemies in much more confined places, making the strategy more difficult to execute. Further on you fight them in water just before the Wharf, where you move more slowly, again making the strategy even more difficult to pull off.

This is great design. Start by teaching a strategy, then make it successively more difficult to execute using the environment. Rather than just make the enemies hit harder and have more hit points, I feel like the designers really put some thought into this stretch. In the first game, it felt like the world designers, monster designers (meaning strategy and move-sets, not the aesthetics), and item designers were all on different teams, and at some point, some guy sprinkled all of those things throughout the game. In DS2, it feels much better designed at a high level, and the teams worked together.

Again I have not played the whole game, but so far:

* No framerate drops like in Blighttown
* No terrible camera behaviors like in Blighttown
* Far fewer monsters clipping through walls and other cheese

Those were the big things that frustrated me in DS1. I have been stabbed through walls in DS2, but not to the scale of say, the golem at the top of the tower in Sen's Fortress, or the huge knights in Anor Londo.

The bosses, so far, have been exciting and fair. I did bang my head a lot on the Royal Rat Authority, (some 15-20 deaths) but I think that was because I lack area-of-effect abilities rather than poor design. Nothing close to the frustration of the Bed of Chaos, where sometimes you just get hit for no reason, or fall through the floor with no warning at all.

Verdict so far: recommended!
