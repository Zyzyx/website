This is more for Mogg than the rest of you I think, but here we go anyway. Some clowns have been working on a Thief mod for Doom 3 for 5 years, and it just went into "beta". I know we've got a long list of games to play already, practically one coming out each week until Christmas, but it might be worth checking out afterward.
