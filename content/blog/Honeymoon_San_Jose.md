Yesterday Muffin and I returned from our Costa Rican Honeymoon, a two week long eco-tour trip. Overall the trip was a success: we didn't think about work or any stress-inducing issues at home at all. Nobody could contact us in any form since cell phones were unusable (I didn't even bring mine or the laptop).

We traveled to 4 locations: San Jose, Tortuguero, Arenal, and Monteverde. The break down of time is as follows: 1 night in San Jose, 3 in Tortuguero, 5 in Arenal, 3 in Monteverde, and 1 more in San Jose. This post will cover both nights in San Jose.

We chose to remain in San Jose for 2 nights because I wanted to see a little Costa Rican nightlife. Unfortunately this ended in disappointment because San Jose is not a very nice city. Practically all windows are barred, razor-wire adorns rooftops, and the locals told us not to be out at night (several sources). I'm sorry, but that city is kind of a dump, and this is coming from a guy that was raised in New Jersey. For the most part we just hung out in the hotels after/before traveling on airplanes for 6 hours.
