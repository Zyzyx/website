Happy New Year everyone, the Year of Predictions is finally here. I made that title up.

Have you been following video game releases for this year? I had not, until Rock, Paper, Shotgun [posed a question to their community](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/01/happy-new-2014-readers/): what are you looking forward to this year? I cruised the comments and found a wealth of recommendations that were interesting at least. There were others that were either not the kind of thing I'm interested in, or the development progress was so vague I doubted it would see a 2014 release.

Here's the list I found, in no particular order. I spared you drab one-sentence reviews.
