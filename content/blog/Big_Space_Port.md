Remember those [4 doom levels I made years ago](http://blogs-brolem.rhcloud.com/node/7)? Well, with Eureka, I touched those up and added 2 more. I renamed the collection Big Space Port, and it was successfully uploaded to the <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?file=levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/bigport.zip">idgames archive</a>.

Maybe in the future I'll continue the mapping, but for now, my bi-annual Doom phase is over. If you need an engine, I recommend <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> for that classic feel, or <a href="http://www.osnanet.de/c.oelckers/gzdoom/index.html">GZDoom</a> for a modern take with improved graphics and sound. You'll still need the original Doom 2 wad file to play it.
