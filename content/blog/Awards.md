These are the Awards available to win, as far as I can remember. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Originally we had a clear list, but over time other character flaws that were more regularly expressed might have become what the Award was associated with.

* Mogg Award: Being a tool. A slave to any authority such as work, your wife, or other responsibilities your friends believe to not be worth your time.
* Illinoise Award: Originally for just being dirty and not showering for a week, but now I think it has become associated with your computer (or other high tech device) misbehaving for unknown reasons. If you regularly get BSODs and can live with that, you've won his award.
* Zyzyx Award: You win this award if you forget something critically important such as tickets to a concert or when to pick someone up at the airport.
* Chris Award: Chris' award is the opposite of Mogg's, you win it if you don't give a shit about something you really should, such as over-drawing your bank account by $300.
* JAJ Award: Earned when you're obviously out of your area of technical expertise. If you just bought a cell phone and haven't figured out how to answer it when it rings, the award is yours.

It occurs to me that Muffin does not have any award. Submitted for you guys' approval, I propose the following be the Muffin Award: Real World Naivet√©. Muffin grew up in New Hampshire which is one of the whitest states in the nation, and is the only one of us still with married parents. (nobody knows what your parents' marital status is, Illinoise) If you think a bunch of teens loitering around the mall with red pants is just a fashion statement, you've just won the Muffin Award. If we're in a restaurant in a bad part of town and I ask, "did it get darker in here?", and you look at the lights, you've just won it again. Take home a third if you bought a warranty for your car you didn't realize you needed over the phone.
