I've decided to discontinue use of "Elder Illithid" today. After reviewing my buddy list, everyone on it that I'm still interested in talking to has an alternate means of reaching me. I've used this account since 9th grade.

Most friends and family reach me on gchat, which is preferred. You can find me on freenode IRC as well as jgreguske (which is registered) or zyzyx (which is not).
