A few weeks ago I was in Seattle for work and met up with a past coworker for dinner. After that came drinks at a place he recommended: [the Bathtub Gin Company](http://www.bathtubginseattle.com/). Imagine an alleyway with two red brick buildings on either side, and one of them has a huge black iron fire-escape. Now put brick walls in the alley in two places to seal away the fire escape and a little room. That's basically what this place looked like.

It is tiny and unassuming, but the atmosphere is perfect for cocktail drinking. There is no food; the lighting is dim, and it is a cozy place to be. There are 3 (maybe 4) floors with 2 bars total, and the poor waitress has to go up and down those stairs a lot. The menu has 2 pages of gins, 2 of whiskeys, and half a page for wine and special mixes. No trendy crap.

My first drink was a "Cassopeia" which was gin, creme de violet, honey and something greenish (not chartreuse). It was tasty, and put me in the mood for something sweeter. I could tell whichever bartender made this was good at it, so now it was time for a test.

The menu offered "dealers' choice", which meant make something up. You could specify a savory (heavy on the spirit, not sweet/fruity), sweet (self explanatory), and sassy (totally random) cocktail. I asked for something sassy that used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine">Benedictine</a>, which is a sweet honey-like liquor. What came back was a magical libation, a potent potable.

It was Gin, Benedictine, Vanille de Madagascar, and Allspice Dram. They did not share the portions; it was like a sweet adult chai tea. It was excellent, would Bathtub again.
