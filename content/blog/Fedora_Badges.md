Fedora contributors can now get [badges](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/) (read: achievements) for doing things like submitting builds, code commits, wiki edits and a bunch of other things. <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/user/886">My badge collection is pathetic.</a> It turns out this has been effective in getting contributors to contribute harder. I cannot say for certain whether it entices new contributors.

I can't say I expected an achievement system for my professional life, but there it is. While I am a package maintainer, I only have 1, it rarely changes, and the user base is tiny; it is probably just me. There are others paid full time to work on more important Fedora packages and it is difficult for me to find the motivation to keep up with them. I'm not trying to complain here, I think the system is an entertaining (and effective!) notion, and I'm glad people spent resources putting it together. Badges could grow into something I'm more interested in pursuing later too.

The team also takes badge suggestions, and a few of them are pretty entertaining. Have a look.
