This past weekend we attended Invasion of Normandy 2010, a paintball scenario game that involves over 3,200 players. We attended last year as well.

Our group was 7 strong this time, up from 3 last year. We had tons of fun. We saw less combat overall this year I think, we spent quite a bit of time hiking in the woods escorting an objective or defending territory. We spent less time on the front lines as well.

The weather was practically a repeat of last year: rain just before the Friday night castle game, then a hot & humid weekend.
