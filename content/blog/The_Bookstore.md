Days before Thanksgiving I visited Lute and his girlfriend at their place in PA. One evening we picked up drinks at a place called The Bookstore. At the time they were having a Thanksgiving-eve special with a unique menu and discounts. The place is a 20's themed speakeasy, and they take the theme seriously:

* Except for 4 or so electric lamps, the entire place is lit by candles and kerosene lamps. The bar and lounge is actually very dark, the pictures on this page are very misleading due to the exposure length being very long.
* Live entertainment: The Midnight Society
* No Vodka in the bar at all. Vodka became prominent in the US in the 50's.
* Menus are sheets of paper glued into the first few pages of old books laying around the lounge and bar. We saw an encyclopedia from the 1940s, which told us to massage mercury on our breasts twice a day if we ever had breast cancer.
* The menus specifically offer popular cocktails during the era. If you order a Sazerac, it'll come with vermouth, not absinthe.

The cocktails at this place where incredible, certainly some of the bets I've ever had. I order an Absinthe and Old Lace; the ingredients of which are egg white, gin, chocolate bitters, absinthe a lemon juice. It was also the only place I've seen where the menu encourages you to order order just by spirit or fruit juice, and the bartenders will figure out what to make for you. It reminded me of very high-end Italian or Thai restaurants where you say, "I feel like this" and the chef makes you something that perfectly suits what you are in the mood for.

It is pricey though, which many cocktails hovering around $12-14. The other downside is the alcohol of course gets you drunk, so you can only enjoy a few libations before you're really just wasting money. Definitely a recommended experience though, you guys would enjoy it. Would do again!
