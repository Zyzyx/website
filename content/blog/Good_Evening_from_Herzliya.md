Good evening from Herzliya! We (a coworker and I) landed at 3pm today, which is 8am your time. I have to say so far the place is great, much nicer than expected. It's like a city in southern California with all signs in Hebrew. Our hotel is on the Mediterranean beach, and we've been to two bars and a seafood restaurant. I'll have pictures up as the trip goes on. For now though, I really feel like I need to sleep. The flight time was 10.5 hours, and you don't sleep well in coach.

Update 1: Been a very busy and productive week.Tomorrow we'll be taking a tour of Jerusalem. If I can take pictures, I will. So far I've been unsuccessful in finding any interesting souvenirs... every store in this city sells clothes or shoes.

Update 2: Today we toured Jerusalem, perhaps the most badass tour I've ever taken. I think I'm holier than Mogg now. Here are the last 3 pictures from the trip that don't involve the Holy City, that deserves a post of its own.

A fantastic way to spend a week, both professionally and personally. I desperately want to travel abroad more often now.
