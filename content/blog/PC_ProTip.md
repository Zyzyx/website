Here's a little ProTip for those thinking about water cooling: (re)tighten the clamps after moving your computer around. Last week I smelled car coolant in the study, and few things will make me that anxious. Long story short, a clamp by the graphics card got loose and had a very slow leak. When I inspected it, the water had flowed around water block and had dripped down onto the case below. At most 2 drops had fallen, and at first glance it didn't appear that any water had come into contact with circuitry.

However, when I started the thing and played Left 4 Dead, it crashed. Twice. And then there were anomalies displaying the background. Rebooted into linux, and even the text before the graphical display manager had come up starting getting distorted. I declared it ... dying.

That was last week before DefCon. Today, I figured I'd make a last-ditch effort to fix it by re-seating the graphics card. Did so, and I was just able to play games for an hour without trouble. It's possible that maybe something just finally dried, but I can still smell the metallic edge of the coolant near the box. Is it fixed? I sure hope so. It would be a tremendous pain to replace that card after fitting a water block on it.
