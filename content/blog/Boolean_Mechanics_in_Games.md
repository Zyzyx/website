In the original Fallout games there were a handful of skills you could use as a player that produced a pass or fail result; you either succeeded or you did not. An example would be using your Science skill to hack a computer. If you successfully made whatever the roll was, you would hack it, and something would happen. If you failed, nothing would happen. Lockpicking is another example. At times there were critical failures, but for the sake of argument I'm going to ignore those because all they meant was you could not try again for a long period of time.

I personally see these mechanics as failures in game design. It is not fun nor engaging to constantly retry the same roll over and over again. Right click, left click, read output, try again if necessary.

Another mechanic was drug addiction. Whenever you took at addictive drug, there was a chance you would become addicted to it. This was one of my favorite ideas in those RPGs, I think Fallout was the first game that had drugs in it that I played. If you did not support your addiction by taking more drugs, you would be slapped with stat penalties until either you took another hit, were cured at a clinic, or suffered long enough through withdrawl. A similar mechanic was crippled limbs: whenever you took a critical hit, it was possible you would have a crippled limb, which incurred severe stat penalties.

While interesting ideas, I view these as failures too, because when you can easily quicksave and quickload, you can easily avoid these novel mechanics. This is bad design. Granted you the player could make the conscious design to not load a new game in these situations, but in my opinion the game mechanics should not be so easily skirted regardless. Nobody likes bad fortune, but the opportunity to trivialize it should not exist.

Fallout 3's design includes these ideas as well, but in some places they improved the mechanic and in others they did not. Addictions can still be reloaded around. If you fail to hack with Science you can reload around that too, or try, try again. However for lockpicking they got the right idea: consume a resource. You use bobby pins to pick a lock, and if you're bad at lock picking, or you're picking a particularly tough lock, then you are more likely to break them. They also grouped locks into 4 categories, and applied minimum stat requirements on the harder ones so that you could not even try in some cases.

I think this is better design. While the player could reload every time they broke a bobby pin, I don't think there is a lot of incentive to do this. They're weightless and not to difficult to find, so players are willing to break a few on a tougher lock. It involves a little skill on the players part; they can influence their success in the lock picking minigame.

I believe the time of boolean (pass/fail) skill checks has passed, gone with older generations of games like the venerable Save Point. In modern games I would much rather see designs that, rather than encouraging reloads, encourage players to spend more of a resource to reach a goal.

For drug addictions a better design would have been to apply an addiction after they've taken a certain number of doses in a certain amount of time. These numbers should have a little randomness to them as well. If you really want to make sure players get it, apply the penalties an hour or so after their most recent dose.

I couldn't think of a better design for crippled limbs though, can you?
