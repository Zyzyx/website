1. Complete World 5.2 of Demon's Souls. This level is entirely poisonous, and even the creators admit difficulty completing it. Do this, and I will value your opinion on games higher than my own. Please take a moment and think about the implications. You could say Bayonetta is a fabulous game, and I would be forced to acquiesce to your better judgement.
2. If you can successfully hack Brolem.net, feel free to be liberal with your new-found privileges, but please don't ruin it beyond repair. This threat will further motivate me to keep aware of security updates and patches. Please note that attacking the hosting environment or the provider itself is not recommended.
3. Respond to my wedding invitation, so you can come to it. Dumbass.
