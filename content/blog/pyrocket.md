I felt like tackling a short-term programming project. I own a USB Missile Launcher but unfortunately I wasn't able to use it at work because the drivers & application it comes with are Windows only.

So I hunted around for a linux solution, and came across one in Ubuntu called pyrocket. Not long after that discovery did I port it to Fedora. I don't have much to test with though; the package works with web cams, other models of launchers, and joysticks. If I get a chance after hours at work some day I'll propose it for inclusion in the distro and lean on others to do the testing for the hardware I don't have. There's some other Ubuntu specific output I'll have to patch out too.

We'll see if it makes it in.
