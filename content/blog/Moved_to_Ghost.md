A snow storm today ruined my routine for chores around the house. So instead of that I migrated my blog from a Drupal deployment to Ghost. I stuck Google+ comments to it for now too.

I've been sitting on a few posts for a while, but putting it off to get this migration out of the way. A lot has been going on professionally and personally.
