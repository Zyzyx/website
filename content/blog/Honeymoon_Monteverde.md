Our last stop was Monteverde, the "Cloud Forest". So named because of the elevation, the mountain tops are over the cloud cover, resulting in forestry that is frequently enshrouded by clouds. The climate here was a welcome change: 70s and much lower humidity. The resort we stayed at was called El Establo.

Like Arenal this part of our trip was dominated by tours and hikes into the forest: butterfly gardens, hummingbird gardens, and more hanging bridges. Towards the end Muffin's knee was starting to bother her, so I finished up by going on a Night Hike and a zipline tour of the canopy.

That's it for honeymoon pictures. I'd do an eco-tour again, but not anytime soon, I'm jungled-out for now.
