Lets get right to the point: I wouldn't even use this piece of shit to bludgeon those bleeding heart assbags on Whale Wars to death. This is going to have a shit ton of spoilers so stop reading if you care. You shouldn't though if you still want to be my friend.

Ok, original story, lets be honest: pretty good. Believable if you're into Sci-Fi. (or SyFy if you're a colossal tool) Evil Corporation is creating any army of soldiers that don't question orders. Why don't they? Because they're telepathically controlled by psychics also created by EvilCorp. Their first try was a woman named Alma that had phenomenal power and couldn't be controlled, so they sealed her up in a pod underground. Oh she had 2 kids too: you (twist!) and the main antagonist, whom you kill at the end. And she escapes.

In F2, you're a completely different guy. But you still have slow-mo powers (because we're still not tired of that kind of gameplay, right?). And a connection to Alma for some reason. They don't really explain it. She trying to kill you throughout the game but shows affection at the end. Or something. And EvilCorp apparently has a hospital (that they do human experiments in, making angry mutants), a grammar school, (that they do human child experiments in, making angry child mutants), and a massive underground railroad to yet another secret facility that has mutants. Also the facility is 5 minutes away on a train. Oh and there's a piece of intel at the end of the game that explains the entire story. I mean from start to finish everything is explained and revealed in that little object.

Anyway, gameplay is exactly the same as the first one, except the pacing is awful. Basically it's an FPS with the occasional view of adult Alma wandering around. When you think the game might finally be getting into some kind of horror fling, the soldiers are back begging for bullets. In case you're still not sure, they'll stick you in a mini-mech for a while or an APC turret. Because you know, in a horror game, few things are more scary than when it's you versus a woman and you have an 80mm fucking automatic cannon and a 4-bay missile launcher. One exception: the grammar school. That was pretty good until the first soldier encounter, then it became just another level.

Oh man the level design is absolutely retarded. On the school level, you needed a keycard to get into the nurse's office. What? Ok maybe that is the way the future is... but you don't need a key card to get into the administration offices. Explain that. Every single level has a boiler-room-esque section or a random subway system.

The ending is an absolute travesty of gaming. If the last level just went right into credits, it would have been better.

Ugh this game is a tremendous disappointment, I'm glad I borrowed it from my brother and didn't spend money on it. This series is dead to me. You can tell how disgusted I am because this post is completely without flow. I just can't spend more time on this game or anything related to it.
