Sans-Serif just got a new computer, and I spent Labor Day playing Half Life 2 mods, so I figured a post about the best of them was in order.

The first one I cannot recommend enough is [Mission Improbable](http://www.moddb.com/mods/mission-improbable/downloads). It's a few hours long, looks fantastic, and easily mistaken for a professional project; it requires Episode 2.

The second was <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/minerva/downloads
">Minerva: Metastasis</a> (see link at the bottom) which was also great, but had a few glitches to note: the waves surrounding the island were a little "off", and I had a few crashes in the second half of the first chapter.

I figured both of these would be a good prelude to the <a href="http://www.blackmesasource.com/">Half Life 1 remake done with the Half 2 engine</a>, which is <a href="http://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=480683#post480683">due September 14th</a>.
