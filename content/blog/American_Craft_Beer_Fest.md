Saturday I attended the [ACBF](http://beeradvocate.com/acbf/), which was a great time. It was sort of a triple-date thing with 2 coworkers and their wives going as well. Between the three of us, we sampled about 10% of the beers available and 33% of the Brewers attending. A paltry ratio to be sure but you can only drink so much within a 4 hour period before getting ejected for obnoxious behavior. Each sample was a 2oz pour, which means by sample #38 I was getting myself in trouble. 

One of the more entertaining parts of the show was the tradition where if someone drops their sampling cup you begin yelling and cheering like someone had said the secret word in Pee Wee's play house. In the last half hour the entirety of the 5000-strong crowd was doing this every 5 minutes, and I found myself wondering how come nobody else had started crowd surfing or peeing off the fire escape. Perhaps I should start the trend?

No, that was the booze talking and that was a terrible idea and I felt ashamed. This was about the time Muffin started rating all beers she tasted with 3 stars. With that behind me here's the list of beers sampled by our group and 5-star scores. For those where the same beer was sampled by multiple people, I averaged the result, rounding down.
