Sans' mention of a Freelancer emulator on Linux (which I could not find) motivated me to setting up a Freelancer server. On Windows 7 after quite a bit of mod/patch downloads, I was able to set up a server and connect to it myself. The procedure I followed was:

* Install Freelancer
* Download and install the 1.1 patch by running the executable
* (Optional) Download the no-CD "patch" and overwriting the Freelancer EXE file
* Download and install the Freelancer Mod Manager (FLMM) by running the executable.
* Download the Discovery Mod. Put it in the mod folder of the FLMM.
* (Optional) Download the HD texture mod. Put it in the mod folder of the FLMM as well.
* Run the FLMM as Administrator. Open your mod folder and double click on the mods you saved there. It should automatically extract them, but be advised it had a habit of popping up confirmation dialog boxes BEHIND other windows, so keep an eye on your task bar.
* Download and extract the Discovery mod update in the Discovery485 folder in your mods folder.
* Activate the mods you extracted in the FLMM
* Run Freelancer from the FLMM.

Maybe we can get a Freelancer round going on Game Night?
