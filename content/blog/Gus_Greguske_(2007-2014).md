Gus was our cat. Muffin made the difficult decision to have him put down a couple days ago after being diagnosed with diabetes a couple months ago. She picked him up from a shelter in Pennsylvania while in grad school, and his company helped keep her focused enough to obtain her PhD. His playful nature responded well to her bright and happy personality. I won't forget the times when she would descend the stairs to the basement while with a book in one hand and Gus in the other, ready to park on the couch while I ganked and swore at people in Dark Souls.

I still do not consider myself a Cat Guy, but I can't help but notice the house is emptier. Nobody greets us at the garage door whenever we return from work, I don't almost trip down the stairs whenever I exit the upstairs bathroom, and I'm not stirred awake in the middle of the night when he invades the bed covers.

RIP Gus.
