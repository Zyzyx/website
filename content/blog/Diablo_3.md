I recognize that the game already sold a bazillion copies, and there's little gamers can do to change the direction of the industries momentum into a connected, always-online model.

For me personally though, the sense of possession some people have on software still feels misguided. Perhaps my employment with a company that professionally involves developing software you can get for free has something to do with it. Software can be duplicated an infinite number of times and shared with numerous people, without detriment to the person doing the sharing. Conversely, sharing a car obviously does have some detriment and even risk to the sharer. This is why I draw line between hardware and software when it comes to ownership; hardware you should be able to do what you want with without permission. The same is true for software, but you should not expect to "own" those changes or modifications.

This distinction gets a little difficult when you have hardware whose express purpose is to tie into a software service; consoles are an example. I would argue that as long as you're not adversely disrupting the service with your hardware modifications, have your way with it. Providers usually disagree with this though, because not all users can be trusted to make sensible modifications that do not impact the service for others. If hacking consoles was ever permitted officially, I'm sure a wealth of security issues would be discovered with these services.

What is disrupting a service? Egregious examples would be denial-of-service attacks, gaining unauthorized access, or negatively impacting others' experience. Then there are less obvious examples: cheating in a single-player capacity, or exploiting a mechanic to get further along. If you're only affecting yourself, isn't that ok?

In the always-on, connected world, that's not always the case. If you're cheating and gaining higher scores and/or achievements that get posted to an online platform, say XBox Live, you're devaluing those services. A negative impact. And granted, not all players care about those sorts of things, but the point is that you're impacting at least some small group that does. Have a look at the Super Meat Boy high score rankings for example. The rankings are listed by number of levels completed and the summation of time (in seconds) taken to complete them. You'll note that the first 100 ranks or so are taken by players with either 0 time, or completing more than 500 levels, which is impossible. That killed my interest in trying to play the game more competitively.

A popular mantra at work is <strong>"never attribute to malice what can easily be attributed to stupidity"</strong>. Software being designed the way it is can have bugs. Maybe the Meat Boy developers, in the early throws of the game were posting bad data to XBL. Maybe the players are not at fault at all, and the implementation of the service is poor. In such cases, that's the best way to judge whether and online service is worth your cash.

Returning to Diablo 3, there are some things I just don't get about their work. You can replay the game in harder difficulty modes: the next one is unlocked each time you complete the current one. You start on Normal (levels 1-32), then move on to Nightmare (32-48), Hell (48+), and finally Inferno (55-60) which is sort of like "end game" content. There are achievements though for completing the game under certain amounts of time or killing bosses without taking a hit. However, all of these are trivialized if you go back to an easier difficulty and cleaning house. Why bother having them at all? It doesn't take any additional thinking, strategy or planning.

Another thing is that items can have stats that increase gold drop rates, and magic drop rates. If you outfit your character with these sorts of gear, you can farm items and gold pretty easily, saturating the auction house with supply and driving down prices, devaluing the gear that I find. Why would they add this impact to their economy?

I suppose I should mention their <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/services/auction-house/">real-money auction house</a>. When you sell gear or gold there, Blizzard takes a cut, so perhaps they're trying to encourage professional farming, which would be counter to what they've done for World of Warcraft (you can farm in that game, but you're not supposed to sell it). The real-money auction house is <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5149181449">delayed indefinitely</a> though, until Blizzard is confident it is safe and secure. Given that battle.net accounts have been <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-21-diablo-3-accounts-hacked-gold-and-items-stolen">getting hacked lately</a>, the outlook for it does not look good. They've never solved that problem for WoW either.

So here we are debating whether the online service is or was worth your money. My play experience is being impacted by others because Blizzard is failing to secure their systems appropriately, and also because of some of the mechanics they implemented in the first place. I didn't buy the software though, I bought access to a service. Yeah it's pretty and sounds good but does it offer the experience I want? Should I be judging it by the usual criteria for off-line games? If I did, I'd give it a solid <strong>B</strong> for the same reasons cited in other game sites. It executes well but fails to innovate, instead opting to use the same formulas and design principles behind Diablo 2.

But it has a mandatory always-online component. Does Blizzard deliver on that end of the bargain? Not to date it hasn't, not for me.

I'm not sure whether to thank them or damn them. Exploring the always-online requirement could be contrued as an innovation, a calculated risk taken by the company. <a href="http://www.brolem.net/brolem/node/821">I praise companies like that</a>. If it works out and the bar is set high enough for others to mime, maybe that future isn't as bad as others think. On the other hand if it doesn't, maybe the trend will reverse, or perhaps we'll see games that offer a new "feature": Can be played in Offline Mode.
