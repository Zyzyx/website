Remember [this game](http://www.3drealms.com/sw/) where you played as Lo Wang? In 2013 a remake was released, and it is actually pretty good if you go in with the right expectations. It brings with it a passable story, pretty graphics, appropriate music, a solid (and simple) leveling system, and of course, his inappropriate swearing and leud jokes.

"You mess with the bull, you get the Wang." You magnificent fuck. 

About 15 hours of gameplay are available in this game, and all of it is entertaining. The S in FPS is more like "slicer" than shooter because you get a sword that stays a viable weapon throughout the game. As you play you'll get ki crystals, karma, and money which can all be used to level up your character in a crude skill-tree sort of system. Your sword will improve over time, and on the harder difficulty settings mastery of it becomes essential.

Don't go in expecting to have your bar raised. It is a linear game just like ye olde times. This is a game for when you're between games, or when you just need to kill time slicing demons into pieces and laughing at stereotypes. One of my favorite mechanics is the Shadow Bunny. In many gardens there will be white bunnies hopping around harmlessly. Sometimes they bump into a mate and start doing the nasty. Classy. If you kill a bunny, sometimes a flaming black bunny will spawn that tries to kill you. While the bunny is alive and attacking, death metal music starts blasting. It does not get old.

I've completed the game on Hard, and I'm working on Insane right now. There is a heroic mode where saving is basically disabled; you have to complete each level without dying. Some of the bosses make me reluctant to attempt this, they require 10 minutes of expert execution; I'm not sure I have that in me, but there is a challenge for those who seek it.

"Crouching Tiger, hidden Wang."
