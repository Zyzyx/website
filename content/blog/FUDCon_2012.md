In a couple hours I'll be boarding flight 3959 to Charlotte from Roanoak, VA, and then flying to Manchester, NH from there. I spent this weekend and Friday at my second [Fedora Users and Developers Conference](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon). This year it was hosted at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.

Friday was pretty informal; I poked my head into several classrooms reserved for FUDCon and looked around to see if I knew anyone. I caught up with a couple folks that work on <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda">Anaconda</a>, <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://pulpproject.org/">Pulp</a>, <a href="http://aeolusproject.org/">Aeolus</a>, <a href="http://katello.org/">Katello</a> and others that I'm sure I'm forgetting. Most of these folks I've met online on IRC or via email at work. That evening we went to <a href="http://www.cabofishtaco.com/">Cabo Fish Tacos</a> despite the cold, 1/2" of snow, and wind.

Saturday was when all of the talks happened. I attended talks about <a href="https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito">Tito</a>, OpenShift, <a href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">GlusterFS</a>, and one about better organizing packages in Fedora. As usual I've got a much longer list of projects to check out, hack around with, and research efforts for work internally. Saturday evening was <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDPub">FUDPub</a>, which had a disappointing selection of beer, and no liquor served whatsoever. After a little pool and standing in line for bowling for an hour, I fled the place with <a href="https://plus.google.com/101645985784674758935/posts">Mike McLean</a>, the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> author.

We went to a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/london-underground-pub-ltd-blacksburg">London Underground Pub</a> and he attempted to explain his mathematical thesis that involved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>. He also delved into how he could prove you could cut a sphere into into 7 pieces and reassemble them into 2 smaller spheres that have the same combined volume as the original. If you're having difficulty visualizing that, it's because you cannot, the method in which you cut up the sphere is non-measurable. When I asked what a non-measurable line looks like, his answer was "it's a fucked up line". I understood what he was talking about for all of 5 minutes, and then went to bed at 1:30.

This morning the FUDCon hackfests and impromptu meetings continued on campus which I made a couple appearances at, but ended up bailing around 1. FUDCon continues to leave me mentally exhausted. The worst part of it is always the realization that I have a week of work ahead of me afterward. The mental exercise is a good thing though. I wish I got more of it.
