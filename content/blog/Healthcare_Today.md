If you're like me, you have an opinion on the state of health care and how to reform it, but not one informed well enough that you're comfortable with being regularly vocal about it. If you're not like me, get a job. Anyway, to assist with getting an informed opinion you are willing to share with others, I've enclosed a series of podcasts from npr.org that really helped me understand how things are today. They don't dwell long on what needs to change or the Right Way to reform it, instead they're mostly educational looks at how healthcare works today. It's a very confusing, complex, and broken system.

If you're interested in current events and how to make sense of health care today, I highly recommend these podcasts. Each of them are 15-20 minutes long, so it'll only take a couple hours to listen through.
