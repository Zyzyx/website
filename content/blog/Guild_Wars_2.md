It's usually dominated by a video game of one form or another, but now it is an MMO, one I've been impressed with and would like to share.

GW2 does a much better job keeping things casual and making it easy to continue playing with your friends. The auto-leveling mechanic in particular surprised me: if you are too high level for an area, your effective level (and gear) will be reduced so that the area is still a challenge. If I go to a new starting area because my friend is playing a different race, it'll be like I'm their level. The experience I get and the gear that drops will still be appropriate for my level too, except for quest rewards.

Speaking of quests, they are handled differently as well: when you arrive near a "quest giver", indicated by a hollow heart over their head, you will be presented with multiple objectives. Each of them contributes to the overall quest progress, so you can do nothing but one particular objective if you want, it is not as stringent as "collect exactly 15 bear asses" like previous MMOs. Gone are the days of slain bears not having an [Ass] for you to collect. Furthermore, you don't compete with other players: everyone sees the same interactive object(s), but if someone beats you to it, that doesn't matter, you can still use it and make quest progress. The same is true of crafting resources: everyone can mine the same copper ore vein, once you've done so, you cannot again for a certain period of time, but everyone else can.

While you are running around the world there are Events that occasionally happen, which like a quest involve a few objectives to complete. The interesting thing is that they scale with the number of players in the area, so if a gang of Centaurs start attacking a town, each wave could be 3-6 or 15-20 depending on the population. You can choose to participate too, the more you do, the higher the experience and currency awards. They're an interesting mechanic that keep the game interesting even as you're running around familiar territory; they help break up the tedium of farming a particular resource for crafting items.

There is no PvP at all in the main world, which makes me a little sad, but I understand the design decision and think it is for the better for casual players. You can teleport to designated PvP areas where in some cases, you are upleveled to 80 (the cap) and equipped from the same pool of items that everyone in the game has access to. This puts everyone on an equal playing field. The only thing gear you can acquire from high end PvP tournaments (or even high end raids) provides is better looks; the stats are the same. This wipes out the gear gaps and discrimination problems from past games.

The graphics are pretty and the audio sounds good. It gets my recommendation, and I hope you'll join me on the Anvil Rock realm before it fills up! The account is Zyzyx.5913.
