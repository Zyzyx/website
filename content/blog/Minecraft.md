I just got out of a mixology class where I've been drinking mixed drinks for 3 hours.

Minecraft touches me in ways I had forgotten about. You punch/mine blocks of resources, then pick them up or craft them into new objects and place them in a game world. The emphasis is on exploration and creativity; you collect resources and use them to build whatever you want. The charming (crappy) graphics and "physics" actually make for a rather intuitive experience.

I play on the attacktheground server. A Google map of our endeavors is available too. My current project is a hollowed out mountain resort.
