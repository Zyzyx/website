Some of you may be familiar with this site already, but for those who are not, I'd like to show you BeerAdvocate, a beer rating site. Their database is considerably large, so you can usually find what you're looking for. The Education section is particularly good to help people "mature" into craft beers when you've had enough Miller Time.

That all said, here are my top 5 beers today. It depends on what I'm eating it with to say which I'll pick; there is no order here.

* Left Hand Milk Stout -- Heavy session drink
:w* Left Hand Sawtooth Ale -- Light session drink
* Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout -- Before a big seafood dish
* Young's Double Chocolate Stout -- Dessert
* Allagash Black -- Just before introducing the arch-villain in D&D
