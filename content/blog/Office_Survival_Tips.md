The last couple months I've been making a habit of going to the mini-gym in the office for 45 minutes or so before starting the work day. This is part of a broader effort to not be a just another flabby white software engineer. As a courtesy to my co-workers, I shower afterward and bring a change of clothes. Recently however, my perfect man-plan had a disastrous oversight.

Working out went without a problem, the mirrors around the room stood and acknowledged my efforts and proclaimed the results to others. The shower was cool and freshing. I lavished my flesh with Axe Bodyspray with the recommended cross-like gesture in the commercials. It was time to change into work appropriate clothes, because I am a business pro, and I go like one. Except when I bring my wife's pants instead of mine. Wait what?

How did that happen? The jeans don't look that similar, I certainly didn't go to the wrong dresser in the morning. One of us must have put it in my drawer. Which of us was the last to do laundry?

...
...
... shit.

It doesn't matter now, I have to get through today. I'm not going to drive back home because I already spent so much time today looking fabulous. I got up at 7:00 so that I could start my day on time, I'm not going to head back and return late and then have to make up an excuse. I brought the wrong pants, so I'm going to wear them. There is no other recourse; I wear the pants here!

<strong>The most important thing is to act natural.</strong> Thankfully, the pants fit reasonably well, and I brought a belt, but of course the cut is all wrong. This is an office full of male software engineers, they barely know how to dress themselves already. I mean look at them. Jesus. Nobody will notice. I just have to act natural and not look vulnerable or guilty. If any were suspicious that I was wearing women's pants, looking conscientious of it would confirm it.

I just have to look really busy at my desk, and never leave it. <strong>Take meetings on the phone</strong> instead of getting up to go to a room. This should be easy. I should <strong>eat lunch at the desk too</strong>. The hours go by, no problems yet. It'll be just another day at the office.

It's 1pm. I shouldn't have drank so much tea. I have to use the restroom, but no problem. Walk confidently and briskly. Things to do. Business pro. Make it to the urinal and !??! wtf? This zipper is tiny! Maybe I can... no. Not enough room. Ok, nobody else is here, <strong>pee in a stall</strong>. Business pro. Sit down because standing up to pee in a stall is what girls do. I mean guys that are insecure, not girls. Whatever we're almost through this.

Back to the desk. Ok, back to work. The last few hours will go by quick, no more meetings, I can just throw on the headphones and get through the rest of the day. Nobody seems to have noticed and most of the day is over.

Crap! A female coworker! <strong>Women know how to dress and will certainly notice their own pants so they must be avoided</strong>. She's coming here. At my desk. No choice, the headphones have to come off and conversation will begin. Can't slide my chair out though. Look busy. Shitshitshit. Conversation is harmless, I'm ok so far, I just can't get up, and must avoid talking about finding someone else to rope in. That would mean I'd have to get up to find them. Recommend more emails. Suggest a meeting tomorrow when you have the right pants. She leaves, satisfied with the engagement.

Made it. End of the day. I <strong>wait a little later than usual to leave</strong> so that the odds of someone catching me are less. Parking lot, almost there. Car. Shit! Pick up the keys, get in. Ignition. I drive out of there, friendly waves and smiles if necessary but not stopping for anything. Home free.

Business pro.
