<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Xenoblade_box_artwork.png" style="float:right"/>I picked this game up because I was curious about how the Japanese Role Playing Game (JRPG) genre has changed since I last played a game belonging to one. The last one I played I think is Final Fantasy 9. It's been a while. I put in 150+ hours into this game.

Xenoblade Chronicles (XC) squarely belongs in this genre, I don't think anyone in their right mind would disagree with that. It turns out the genre has not progressed much, at least in my opinion. The characters are predictable archetypes we have seen before: the loud boisterous big guy, the protagonist is reserved and quiet, the silly non-human partymate (a "Nopon", no Moogles in this game). The interactions between the characters are largely uninteresting, and the party banter is annoying: "we're the best!", "we can definitely do this!", "you were amazing!"... it gets repetitive fast.

The systems around developing your characters are complex and confusing. The UI design for some aspects of the game is awful. The "Linking" menus are the worst, but the affinity graph being unable to search is pretty bad too. The quest journal is lousy... frequently important details are omitted or unsearchable. The game is certainly grindy in that regard: finding that one item or NPC in a huge world can be frustrating.

Recall that I put in 150+ hours into this. That's because I expected all of these design shortcomings. If you liked the JRPG genre the way it was 10 years ago, you'll still like it now. There hasn't been any significant progress. I can understand [criticisms toward the genre](http://www.gamesradar.com/are-jrpgs-dead/) but I still found myself completing every quest I came across, catalogging every item in the collectopaedia, maxing out every affinity between the characters, completing the Colony 6 restoration, and killing the first few Superbosses. You can finish the game at about level 75, but I did it at 97 because there was so much more to do beyond beating the game.

I don't really want to get into a discussion on whether the JRPG is dead or not. I know sales are declining, but there will always be people like myself that want to revisit the Old Times of RPGs. 5 years from now I'll probably be doing it again.
