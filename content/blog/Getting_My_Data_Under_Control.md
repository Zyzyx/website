title: "Getting My Data Under Control"

One of my new years' resolutions was to better understand how data about me on the internet is being used by corporate entities and governments, and better control it on my end. I realize it is nearly impossible to control it completely, my mortage information was resold mere weeks after getting a house; Google has been vaccuuming up my browsing habits for years, and Verizon does it on my phone. Despite that, my goal is to understand what I can and do what I can. With that at least I'll have an informed opinion of the current state of affairs and can help spread awareness of something I think is rather important.

Maybe I should start with a problem statement of why I think mass surveillance is a bad idea. Part of the reason is I think it should be illegal, and the rest is because of social and technical reasons. I'm keenly aware of people posting political screed on NPR comments that makes them sound like crackpots, and I'm really trying to avoid that here. Really, my life hasn't changed much at all because of mass surveillance, so I acknowledge the world is not ending because of this issue. "Privacy" isn't in the Bill of Rights at all, so what's the problem?

Illegal search-and-seizure is in the Bill of Rights though, that's [item #4](https://www.aclu.org/united-states-bill-rights). The cops are not allowed to show up at your house and take your stuff without a really good reason (a warrant). If you imagine personal data about you being rolled up into one file or thing, I think that is something that should be protected too. To help illustrate, and here's an incomplete list of personal data you may be sharing with the government:

* phone records (maybe conversations if you're using VoiP)
* health records, prescriptions, diagnoses
* anything in email: spam marketed to you, who you're sending to and receiving from
* stuff you've bought on the internet
* stuff you've bought with a credit card
* videos you watch, music you listen to on the internet
* apps you download and use on your phone

I could go on, but again, I'm trying not to sound like a crackpot. I know you hate youtube comments too. This information is certainly stored on different computers owned by different companies, and it is unlikely that they share all of that with each other.

But here's the thing, the NSA in the US and other state-sponsored agencies (especially the UK) are actively trying to put that stuff together to create a profile of you. The technical details around how they do that are for another post, but basically Snowden revealed that. You can read about this yourself on <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">EFF.org</a>, which is a privacy advocacy group, or from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden?page=32">The Guardian</a>, which is where a lot of his leaked information was printed. So, I agree with groups like the EFF on the illegality of mass surveillance. I have opinions on why it is a bad idea for the future too, both socially and technically, but that's enough for now.

Nobody reads long posts, so I'm going to summarize what is coming later in the year.

* Complete a list of sites and companies that have information about me stored that I am actively contributing to. I'll never be certain who they are sharing with, so that is out of scope.
* Post about what I did to either cease sharing, anonymize the information, or make it useless. There will be some entities I do nothing about.
* Explain how to take protective measures for my data in general. Or you can go <a href="https://pack.resetthenet.org/#protect-yourself">here</a> and not have to wait for me.
* Explain how mass surveillance is being conducted by various state agencies and governments.

Hopefully your eyes didn't roll much while reading this. :)
