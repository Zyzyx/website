Figured I'd share a list of games I'm interested coming up in the next 6 months. Watch out for noise and Flash-orgies in some of these links.

    Borderlands on October 20th
    Starcraft 2 in the first half of 2010.
    Dragon-Age: Origins on November 3rd
    Bioshock 2 in the first half of 2010. See also this if you're an Invader Zim fan.
    Assassin's Creed 2 on November 17th
    Max Payne 3 this winter.
    Left 4 Dead 2 on November 17th.
    Super Mario Brothers Wii on November 15th. 

There's also Supreme Commander 2 which is some time next year. What are you guys looking forward to?
