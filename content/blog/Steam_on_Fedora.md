I'm a little late to the party but I got the Steam beta working on Fedora 17 with about 10 minutes of effort. I followed [this guide](https://russellbryantnet.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/installing-steam-for-linux-beta-on-fedora-17/). Currently Frozen Synapse, Amnesia and TF2 are available to play; I have not tried any yet since they need to be re-downloaded.

Update: Amnesia seems to work fine!

Very promising!
