<ul>
  <li>My latest music interest is [Caravan Palace](http://www.caravanpalace.com/)</li>
  <li>We still have 1.5 feet of snow on the ground</li>
  <li>Last week was my 5 year anniversary at Red Hat. Each year I think, "yeah I do can one more of these"</li>
  <li>I'm in NJ for a couple days training up my 4th engineering group on how Red Hat manufactures software</li>
  <li>I'm staying with my dad and half-sisters (age 3 and 2) for 3 nights this week</li>
  <li>Wednesday afternoon I will have lunch with my 91 year old grandmother, who will drive herself to a place she suggested called The Mason Jar</li>
  <li>I will be struck by a keen awareness of generational gaps</li>
  <li>Liz is on Spring Break, I expect her to be passed-out, topless, and covered in romance novels when I get back</li>
  <li>Liz has also begun cat-hunting in the various shelters within a 20 mile radius</li>
  <li>I have been playing a lot of Dark Souls 2 and Path of Exile</li>
  <li>I've also being playing drums a fair bit, focusing on paradiddles and meter modulation. In other words I'm doing a lot of rolls around the kit and flipping between 6/8 and 4/4 time. Still an amateur</li>
  <li>The next house project is to re-do the back porch, which is slowly sinking into the ground and warping the wood-composite</li>
  <li>Have not been pursuing the small-electronics hobby or paintball in the last 2 seasons, but I mean to pick them up again</li>
</ul>
