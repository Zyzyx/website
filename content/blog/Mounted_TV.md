The first home-improvement project we had turned into a lengthy and rewarding father-son project. The goal was to mount our 42" plasma above the fireplace; no wires showing afterward either. As you can see in the picture on the left, we were successful. Here is how that effort went.

Not long into our effort did we discover a critical problem. Above the fireplace there were no studs, just a trio of 2x8's that were rotated 90 degrees; e.g., the wide portion was facing us. While not true studs, they were at least load-bearing, so we continued with the plan to use them. The other issue was that they were about 32/36" apart, and not evenly spaced. We could buy a really wide bracket to span across the fireplace, but then you'd be able to see it beyond the sides of the TV itself, so that was out.

If you look at the diagram below on the right, the grey-shaded boxes are those 2x8s. Our TV is 5 years old, so the thing weighs about 80-90 pounds. TV mounting brackets require the use of at least 1 stud to support the weight, but since we didn't have one, I was leary of using it and drywall to support the TV. The holes where you screw in the bracket are very far apart compared to more recent televisions to; they are about 33" apart. In short, we were forced to add another mounting point beyond the 2x8 near the center of the fireplace.

The exterior walls around the fireplace are bumped out to make room for the flume, and the fireplace itself is not a "real" fireplace: it is gas, and mostly for display. It does not have a blower nor produce very much heat. It has a chimney, but not in the stone-hearth sense, it is just a ventilation pipe in the wall that goes out to the roof.

We ended up cutting a hole in the wall large enough to fit a head through. <strong>Home-ownership Lesson: only cut into walls when you're ready to handle what is behind them.</strong> Our house had a significant mouse infestation before we owned it, and in the space between the exterior walls and the interior drywall above the fireplace, there was the mouse expressway. Insulation had fallen in on top of the fireplace unit because they had eaten so many holes into it. The pile below was thoroughly ridden with nests, poop, and mouse remains. We pulled out everything that fell in, but could not put new insulation along the exterior wall (we simply could not reach), so we probably lose a few dollars a month in heating costs. It could not have been healthy or safe to leave it as-is though.

The next step was to run the wires. We wanted power, 2 HDMI, and 2 5-RCA component lines. The challenge was fitting those RCA cables through holes we were drilling through the studs to get them to near the consoles. With a little electrical tape we were able to feed the plugs one-at-a-time through the holes. We also had to get holes through the floor, inside the wall, so that we could run our [own circuit from the circuit breaker](http://www.brolem.net/brolem/node/825). After cutting 4 more holes into the walls (2 for directing wires, 2 for the recessed boxes where the wires terminated), we had that figured out. Muffin got home about this time and did a good job hiding her concern about the mess we were making.

One story worth mentioning is getting a hole through the floor to the basement. <strong>Home-ownership Lesson: my dad is crazy when it is not his house.</strong> After the hole was cut out of the wall, he looked at the insulation that greeted him for a few moments. He took the drill and jammed it downward into the insulation and through the floor. It took him about a minute to finish, and the whole time he was buried up to his elbow in insulation and woodchips. If I had done that, I would have found the spot that water pipes, power lines, and gas pipes all were next to eachother. When I asked him if he thought drilling blindly was a good idea, he said, "whatever it's not my house".

With that complete and the insulation cleared out, we used three 2x4s to create another mounting point in the wall, those are the dotted-line boxes. The vertical 2x4 ends up being flush with the back of the drywall. We used 3" wood screws to hold them in place. We closed up the wall, hit it with joint compound, painted it, and then mounted the bracket without incident.

Ta da! Project #1 complete. #2-10 will be little things like removing phone jacks or changing out lights in the ceiling. The next big project is finishing the basement, which is at least a few months out.
