I'm tempted to bring the full balls-to-the-wall hatefest for this but really I just can't make myself care enough to get riled up. It's more Halo, and you've seen what Halo is. There is nothing to be said for graphics, sound and gameplay that you haven't already been exposed to.

New weapons: a flamethrower and a silenced SMG. You see the flamethrower in one mission, and there is only one of them. The silenced SMG does awful damage and is near useless in Legendary. I didn't see anything unique happen with respect to the silenced effect of the gun, but then maybe because I've only played on Legendary ambushes are harder to set up. There is a new grenade too, but honestly you throw it and it explodes and that's all I remember about it.

Since you're just an ODST, a regular marine, you're not as super human as Master Chief. You take falling damage. You don't have shields: instead they renamed it to stamina. As you take damage your screen gets redder until you're tired (or whatever) and then your health suffers until you can find a health pack. It's the same gameplay mechanic though. You can still rip off turrents and flip warthogs back over though, because the fans probably liked those gameplay elements and we're not interested in consistency here.

One bit of praise I do have is the Firefight type of multiplayer game. Get some friends and fight endless waves of covenant. That is pretty fun, and the idea should have made it into Halo 2 when we first heard about it.

The game is a little less linear: you can pick which missions you want to do by inspecting various items/plot devices in the streets of the main "hub" level. I like the direction they were going with that and how it tied to the story, but it is still totally ignorable if you're not playing for story.

The two major characters are annoying as hell. They once had shared a relationship and struggle to figure out where it fits in their military life. One is female and sports the usual the usual tough-grrrl attitude and gets annoying within 2 sentences of dialog. The other is the captain from firefly. Not only does he look the same, but is voiced by the same actor, and the dialogue is set up for him to deliver his characteristic one-liners and humor whenever possible. I'm fine with wrapping in a little fan service, but when he bitches at you to fight harder because he trained 10 brutes to your location for the 5th consecutive reload it gets a little annoying. He he he! Trouble always follows Mal! Douche bag.

All of the important NPCs in the game are invincible too, unless the objective is "protect this NPC", in which case they dash ahead like Olympic sprinters whenever possible to get ganked by a squad of jackals later. Again perhaps my frustration is warranted since my only experience was on Legendary.

Beh I think that's enough reviewing for this game. If you're tired of Halo, don't bother, or at least wait until the price comes down. If you can't get enough of it, then have some more, it's still polished and pretty like the ones before it.
