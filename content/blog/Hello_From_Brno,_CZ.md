I'm writing this message from Brno, a city in the Czech Republic! It began by flying into Amsterdam, picking up a connecting flight to Vienna in Austria, and then taking the Student Agency bus to Brno. From there I have been taking trams around the city to get around. I created a [map to track places I've visited](http://goo.gl/maps/MpvGK) while I am out here. Last night I caught dinner with a local coworker (and another coworker from Chicago) at the Pegas Pub. I got in the area a little after 5pm Brno time (which is 11am EST) so I didn't see many familiar faces yet, but that will change as I get in the office properly in the morning today. 

My initial impression was that Brno looks a lot like a college town. There are 2 technical universities here and the majority of people I see walking around at night are 20-somethings. If you stand around in the sub-40 degree weather you'll see the occasional party of drunks hopping on and yelling at each other on their way to the various bars. So far downtown has looked very walk-able, even at night. I have seen police cars but their presence does not seem to be very heavy, and I have seen a fair bit of graffiti tags. Just things to notice so far. Smoking is still a thing here, you can smoke in bars and pubs.

The distance to the office and the hotel is about a mile, which I plan to walk this morning. You may have noticed I'm posting this at 1am Brno time. Jet lag is lame.
