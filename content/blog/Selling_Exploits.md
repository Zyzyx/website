[ThreatPost has an interesting pocast](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/chris-soghoian-exploit-sales-110812) that features Chris Soghoian talking about the sale of software exploits. This has been going on for years, but it's growing into more of an "open secret", according to him. They know what they're doing and are ok with having invite-only parties at public events like DefCon or BlackHat.

The SciFi-Cyberpunk nerd in me thinks it is awesome that this is a thing that exists in our world. Corporations selling vulnerabilities to other corporations, or even governments is something right out of Science Fiction. Of course, the realist in me, the one that actually directs what I do in the real world, is quite concerned. 

The commentary on regulating the market is interesting too. Can you see a world where the sale of software vulnerabilities are regulated like the sale of weapons to other countries? Do you think it can even be regulated?
