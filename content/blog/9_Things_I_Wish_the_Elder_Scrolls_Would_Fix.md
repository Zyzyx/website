There are 5 Elder Scrolls games: Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and most recently, Skyrim. While all decent games, there are some behaviors that just never seem to get get fixed: they afflict at least 3 of the 5 games. Here they are in no particular order.

<strong>Waterfalls do not sound like garden hoses draining from your rooftop.</strong> It is painfully obvious sometimes that Bethesda's Audio guys have never been to a real waterfall. There are quite a few shallow rapids that don't sound right either.

<strong>Forgotten tombs should not have fresh carrots and potatoes in burlap sacks.</strong> I'm not sure if this is just the result of a loot algorithm being poor or if developers just didn't think about it. Who stores produce in a barrel in a sunken cave anyway?

<strong>Lousy use of shadows.</strong> I think this is just a symptom of making it accessible and streamlined or whatever. There is never any use of darkness in this game other than as a mechanic for sneaking. Everything, I mean everything, is lit adequately enough so that you can see around. All caves have glowing fungus. All crypts have lit braziers or torches. This renders use of light spells and night-vision almost non-existent. Why even have them?

<strong>The player physics continues to suck.</strong> I'm not talking about the jittery ragdoll effects or items tumbling about unrealistically. I mean that I can still walk sideways up a mountainside if I want to. It is trivial to get where you're not supposed to go in the game world. I don't understand how this became acceptable.

<strong>Your allies are dumb as hell.</strong> They step on pretty much every trap. They still get hung up on world geometry and spawn or blink around whenever you step over an obstruction or jump over a hole. If you happen to be exploring a dungeon that requires you to jump down a pit or chasm, cross your fingers. Also they love standing in the middle of the hallway.

<strong>In fact, all NPCs are dumb as hell.</strong> I stole the entire contents of a shop and sold them back to the proprietor. I've stolen all of the vegetables in a farm in front of the field worker and sold them back. [This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27GuSSha0s#!) spends his day putting baskets on peoples' heads. GAME OF THE YEAR.

<strong>You never get any recognition for you major accomplishments except from the quest-giver itself.</strong> If I'm the Arch-Mage of the magic college, why do guard still mock me like an urchin in the streets? I understand this behavior if I'm not wearing anything that indicates I'm from the college, but when I'm wearing the robes and amulet? Come on.

<strong>Cities are sprawling metropolises of 15 people.</strong> I think Assassins' Creed was the only medieval-era game that pulled off a populous city effectively.

<strong>Let me disable the hand holding.</strong> I don't need or want the quest markers. Give me some general direction at least, but don't tell me exactly where the book I need is in a dungeon.
