A co-worker of mine was sharing this secret the other day. Coffee without the characteristic bitterness. Extraordinarily smooth. Even Liz could drink it black. Follow these instructions to enjoy it yourself:

1. Buy this. Sorry, few things are free.
2. Put a pound of coarse-grind coffee in the bottom vessel.
3. Fill the top vessel with room-temperature water (or cold, whatever), and let the unit sit for 12-24 hours.
4. By the next day you'll have a coffee concentrate. Do not drink this straight, you'll wish for death. The concentrate keeps for about 6 weeks.
5. When you're ready for a cup, combine some of the concentrate with hot water; about a 1:3 ratio.

It's hard to describe what it tastes like, and I find it hard to call it coffee because it literally is not bitter at all. The reason is because hot water more readily draws acids from the grinds, which is where the bitter taste comes from. Colder water does not. It tastes like it smells.
