On Friday I attended Whisky Live in Boston. It was held on the 33rd floor of 60 State Street, which is a classy venue for sure: tall windows overlooking the city-scape at night, live jazz music, and 43 vendors offering various whiskies.

There were far fewer scotch whiskies there than I expected, and far more bourbons and ryes. There were even some tequilas and vodkas, which I skipped. I noticed a trend of having maple-infused bourbons too, many of the vendors offering such were based in Vermont. I was still able to broaden my palette on scotch whiskies though, despite these American experimentations. (snobbery++)

Anyway, here's the list of distillers I felt were notable.

</ul>

My strategy to handle the ride home was to eat a full meal (a buffet was put on by 4 Roses) first. After every quarter of the vendors was visited, go back upstairs and eat a small plate of tator-tots with a glass of water and listen to music. The exhibition went from 5:30 to 10, but I had my fill by about 8:30; I took a 15 minute walk to the car to be sure a buzz was not going to creep up on me.
