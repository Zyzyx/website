Our second stop was Arenal. There are 112 volcanoes in Costa Rica, only 7 of which are active, and only one of which has the characteristic cone-shape. Arenal erupted in 1968, leveling a town and killing 65 people. It erupted again in 1992, with 5 injured.

Today it erupts fairly frequently, but they're small and harmless. It erupted 3 times while we were watching: twice at night and once during the day. At night was cool because we could see the lava cloud and riverlets running down the slide of the mountain. During the day we just saw a puff of dark smoke. In all cases there was a rumbling like deep thunder; it is exactly what you should not be getting used to.

Near Arenal is La Fortuna, a small tourist town. It was one of the first places we visited to get supplies and do laundry. It was much nicer looking than San Jose.

Our tours in Arenal consisted mostly of hikes and walks near the volcano. You cannot walk far up the volcano itself, the are no permanent trails since lava keeps clobbering them. Also, it is like hot enough to melt your shoes after you get half-way up.

One of the more memorable parts of our stay in Arenal was taking the Hanging Bridges Tour. In the forested reserve people have erected huge bridges that overlook the forest canopy giving tourists an unusual view of the forest from above.

Arenal was nice, but Tortuguero was better in my opinion. The volcano put on a good show for us though, so that was worth it.
