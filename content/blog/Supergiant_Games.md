The video game studio [Supergiant Games](https://www.supergiantgames.com/), creators of <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/">Bastion</a> and <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/">Transistor</a>, have succeeded in becoming one of may favorite studios. Their company goal:

```
We want to make games that spark your imagination like the games you played as a kid.
```

A bold statement, but I think they've succeeded. They both sport bright colors and a unique art style that is instantly recognizable. Music supports their games exactly like music should, you can listen to complete albums for <a href="http://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/album/bastion-original-soundtrack">Bastion</a> and <a href="http://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/album/transistor-original-soundtrack">Transistor</a>. Both games have a companion character that speaks to you, the player, and throughout the game and the voice acting is perfect. It never gets tired.

What I mean by that is how the rules of the game are presented to the player, how they're taught and built upon, and finally tested against. In both games they're presented cleanly with little ambiguity. The achievements for the game support exploring the rules, not repetitive grinds or time sinks.

I recently finished Transistor for the second time, so while that is fresh in my mind I can give an example of what I'm talking about. One of the main mechanics of the game is you acquire **functions** that you can assign to one of four available slots. Much like MMOs or other action RPGs like Diablo, each function has a cooldown and you can use it again after a set period of time passes. You collect a total of sixteen functions, so you have to pick carefully, since you can only assign four.

In addition to that, each function has 2 upgrade slots, and you can put functions in there too, which enhance the base function with additional powers. If you combine Void() with Get(), the function will yank enemies into the area of effect in addition to weakening them. The are many, many combinations of powers, all well thought out, unique, and viable.

Beyond even that the player unlocks 4 additional slots that functions can be put into for a passive affect. An example would be a resistance to stunning effects or an increase to damage when you attack an enemy from behind. Study <a href="http://transistor.gamepedia.com/Functions">this table</a> a bit to see what each function does for each type of slot it is placed into. Now, I know ability-based RPGs are nothing new, nor is this kind of gameplay where you bash bad guys in real time from a third person perspective. My point is in how these mechanics are exposed to the player. Not long after getting a few functions is the player encouraged to mix and match them to try other effects. This is motivated with achievements and optional **tests** that the players can optionally play at certain points in the game. There were several instances where I found a combination of abilities I liked better than I had been using for some time.

I find it remarkable that this indie company successfully designed their first two releases so elegantly. It sure seems to me like several industry veterans started the company, and not a small group of passionate beginners. Supergiant Games does not get enough exposure.
