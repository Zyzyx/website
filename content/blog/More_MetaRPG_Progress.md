Work continues on MetaRPG. Do those stats on the left in the screenshot look familiar? I took the program through a real use case tonight: building a 4th edition character sheet template. I thought of a few usability improvements on the way but the core functionality felt complete. Chat works too, although only if you want to talk to yourself. The purple text near the bottom are hotlinks: similar to linking items in WoW you can link items or skills (or anything really) into text so others can mouse over and see the stats.

The biggest problem I have with self-imposed programming projects is what we in the biz call "Feature Creep". I keep thinking of cool things to add, and because I keep revising my work, I never get closer to a finished state. It's getting there though, just takes time. Just don't ask me for a date. I still have to write the server component, port everything to Windows, write the installer...

By the way, if anyone wants to help out with creating dozens of 16x16 icons, let me know.
