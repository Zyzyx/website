Mogg recently brought my attention to Bioshock Infinite, a game I have a skeptical view of. Before continuing with this post, I highly recommend you read an interview with Ken Levine and one with Timothy Gerritson. There is a game-play video as well. Well, sort of a game-play video. Ok, not really, but it is still cool to watch.

After reading Levine's interview, I had renewed interested in the franchise. The most interesting thing in Bioshock for me was not the plot, not the gameplay, but the setting. I liked discovering how Rapture fell, how society was coming apart when human ingenuity and discovery ran too far. I played through the first 2 levels of Bioshock 2 and lost interest. It felt like more of the same and didn't hold me. Everything that needed to be explored in the setting had already been explored, there wasn't anything more to add to it. This is echoed in Gerritson's statements. Also multiplayer? Seriously?

According to him though, Bioshock Infinite is a completely separate and distinct world from Bioshock (One). It sounds like this game will share similar themes to the original game: this grand city in the sky is falling apart too, and you the player will discover why. This is part of the lure for me, and I definitely am interested in a new setting as deep as Bioshocks. The art direction and time period is much the same as the original as well.

Then I read Gerritson's interview, and my marketing bullshit detector started going off. While the first Bioshock was great, I haven't forgotten the hype surrounding it and emphasis on player choice. Your actions have consequences! What will you do!? Oooh, I'm in control here. Actually no, you just have to decide whether you kill little girls for resources, and that decision controls what ending you see. Obviously I killed them frequently. The player-choice hype was a load, it was an excuse to get you to play the game a second time, just like Infamous.

Gerritson contradicts himself multiple times, and that makes him a taffer. Maybe he's just bad at articulating what Levine tried to get across: Bioshock is not about a underwater world that fell apart, it's about worlds that have fallen apart because of some unrestrained aspect of human creativity. I like this concept. I'd be interested in more steam-punk worlds beyond a sky city or sunken slum that fall apart for some reason. However I'm also keenly aware of how Irrational's discussion with 2K about a new game may have really went:
```
2K: What do you guys want to do next?
Irrational: We want to create an entirely new FPS game!
2K: Fine, but slap Bioshock's title on it so it will sell and draw attention.
Irrational: OK!
```
For now, I'm cautiously interested. What about you?
