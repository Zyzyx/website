Yesterday we successfully closed on a house in NH. Now we begin the lengthy task of painting and decorating the thing. Afterward I discovered we live down the street from the chief of police, so there goes my hobby of building cannons for everyday objects like potatoes or soda cans. :(

Also, happy new year.
