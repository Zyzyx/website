Wizards of the Coast [posted early drafts of the Core Rules of D&D Next](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules), also known as 5th edition. Whether this will remain in place when it actually releases with hard cover books or not I do not know. They're very slim with only a few classes, races, and spells.

I looked over the PHB for an hour and I was surprised by the return of a lot of earlier mechanics such as spell slot progressions, and all 9 alignments. I really like the advantage/disadvantage system they've come up with. When I have a more informed opinion I may post more about this subject later.
