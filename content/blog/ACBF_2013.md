Once again Muffin and I went to the [American Craft Beer Festival](http://beeradvocate.com/acbf/) in Boston. We <a href="http://blogs-brolem.rhcloud.com/node/854">went to it last year </a>as well. For this post I'm just going to indicate what we've tasted so far, this includes both me and Muffin's observations, taking an average if we both tried one. Last year's post can be reviewed to understand what the event is like. Thankfully it was indoors, away from the 92 degree heat.

Once more the rating is a scale from 1 to 5.
