Muffin and I learned to ski last weekend up at Killington, VT. We had 2 days of it with great weather and the instructors were very good at what they do. By the end of it we were exploring green trails on our own and risked a blue one where we each fell once or twice.

Even at the end of March the (manufactured) snow was in good shape and there was plenty to check out. We've wanted to downhill-ski for quite a long time; it's an expected skill if you live in NH. We've got a few more lift tickets and rentals already paid for thanks to the "Learn to Ski" package we paid for, so hopefully when the season starts up again we'll be back at it. I think it'll be more than a one-time-thing, it turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would.
