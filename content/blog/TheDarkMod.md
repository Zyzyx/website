A new [Thief](http://www.thiefgame.com/) comes out later in February, but there's been a few red flags that have me suspicious. I'll be watching it, but I'm waiting for reviews now instead of pre-ordering or purchasing the day-of. Check out the site and see if you come to the same conclusions.

I've been playing <a href="http://www.thedarkmod.com/main/">TheDarkMod</a>, a fan-made stand-alone game that behaves a lot like the older Thief games. It was originally a mod for the Doom 3 engine, but back in October it was re-released as a standalone program. I encourage you to give it a try, I've finished 3 missions so far. It comes with 1 mission, the rest you have to download through the browser built into the program. There is no over-arching story, you just grab missions that sound interesting and play until you're bored. I'll post about the ones I've tried in the comments as I complete them. 

Fan Missions (FMs) are created using the Dark Radiant editor. I recognize that name from editing Quake maps back in the day but I'm not sure there is a relation. I may pause a bit in the coming weeks to look this over once my doom editing contributions are behind me. I feel like I could make a pretty good Thief map.
