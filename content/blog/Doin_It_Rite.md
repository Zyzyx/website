I have to call this out in a separate post. All 5 days I was in Ra'anana office were mostly spent in meetings with development team leads. At 10am each day we'd spend two hours talking about what was resolved, and what needs to be, they were meetings to keep the group focused for the day. The next 6-8 hours were informal meetings between the 2 of us from Release Engineering, and whichever team leads felt like sticking around.

I enjoyed every minute of these discussions. It's not often in one's software career that you get to work with other teams and architect a project from the ground up entirely. Only two of us are going to be implementing the solution, and the problems we'll have to solve on the way are not easy. I'm not getting into what it will do or who it will impact, I'll just say it is significant to the company as a whole.

The purpose of this post is not to brag about the weeks accomplishments but rather characterize why I'm in the software development field in the first place. It's not about writing code, finding bugs, gaining recognition, or managing process. It's about solving hard problems; novel ones that very few have broached before, let alone have the capacity to solve.

And there were a lot of them. Several times during these meetings I or someone else would stop, pause, and utter something to the effect of, "I don't know the best way to do this", or simply, "I don't know." I like solving problems on my own, particularly complex ones, but when I need to fly to another country to meet 4 or 5 brilliant people in person to solve a huge laundry list of issues, now we're into a whole new realm of interesting and exciting. Sometimes we'd spend an hour or two rat-holed on the same issue just bouncing ideas at each others. Remember I'm in a room with a bunch of Israelis too... so things get animated sometimes. I think next time I'll bring boxing gloves.

Professionally, this business trip was the most engaging and interesting thing I've ever done. Each day I left the office utterly drained mentally. Maybe the jet lag was a factor too.

I won't drag this on. This week, I was doin' it right.
