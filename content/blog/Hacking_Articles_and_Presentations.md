I scraped a complete set of issues from [Phrack](http://phrack.org/) Magazine. You can always peruse them on their site too, but in case it ever goes down, we have our own copies. If you want to be a l337 hax0r from when the sc3n3 was hip, <a href="http://download.brolem.net/Zyzyx/phrack/">read a few articles<a/>.

For more modern and practical hacking, I grabbed <a href="http://download.brolem.net/Zyzyx/defcon/">all non-video presentations from Defcon 10-19</a>. The conventions before that are mostly video recordings with poor sound. You can get most of these off of the <a href="http://www.defcon.org">Defcon site</a> as well, but I'm too lazy to search.
