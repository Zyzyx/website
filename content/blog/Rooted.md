Before Christmas Muffin and I gave each other Galaxy S4 mobile phones. It was time to upgrade. They were by Samsung, model SCH-I545, Android version 4.3 and a baseband version of VRUEMK2. Those bits of data are important for people who want to root the device using [these instructions](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2565758). The XDA forums are the place to go for this sort of information; they were shockingly easy this time around. Far easier than the Incredible.

Once the phone was rooted, I installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvkdevelopment.nobloatfree">NoBloat</a>, an app that removes system apps. Finally I can get rid of the pre-installed Samsung and Verizon shit I don't want. What pushed me over the edge this time was when I decided to update a few apps, I had more than 20 pending, and I didn't recognize a third of them. Using a <a href="http://www.downloads.galaxyunlocker.com/List-of-bloatware-apps-safe-to-remove-Samsung-Galaxy-S3-S2-GalaxyUnlocker.com.pdf">spreadsheet</a> I was able to safely remove them.

It's not a question of reclaiming space on the device, or always seeing apps I don't care about in the listings, although that is annoying. The primary driver is I do not trust these organizations to maintain good software for the duration I will use the phone. Ars Technica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/smart-tvs-smart-fridges-smart-washing-machines-disaster-waiting-to-happen/">makes a good argument</a> about this too. Cell phone makers and cell phone carriers are not software companies.

I only want to use their content to the extent I have to, and I'm glad to be rid of most of it now.
