I just saw 9 with Liz, and discovered that it is one of those movies I wish I first saw with you guys (and with Liz). From start to finish this movie is incredibly imaginative, filled with silent commentary about what humanity is, and displayed with the creepiness of Tim Burton at his finest.

Fantastic movie: 10/10. I'm usually conservative with perfect reviews, and I hope the fact that I raved about District 9 only a few months ago doesn't dilute this recommendation. Go see it.
