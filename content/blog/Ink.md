I can't remember if one of you guys recommended this, but I just saw Ink via Netflix. It's an indie movie, so expect something unusual when you're watching it. It's also a mind trip, so be in a good mental state too if you want to have any chance of understanding it on deeper levels.

Anyway I found it to be very enjoyable and recommend it.
