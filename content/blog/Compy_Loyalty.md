A [podcast from a couple years ago](http://experiencepoints.libsyn.com/exp-podcast-128-pledging-brand-fealty) prompted this question in my mind: Can you name 10 companies you would identify yourself as loyal to? Would you stick with them through the good times and the bad? Please omit the ones you work for since loyalty is implied there.

I can easily come up with a list of companies I despise. Here's those I like though, for now at least:

<ol>
  <li>CD Projekt Red (The Witcher Developer)</li>
  <li>From Software (Demons' and Dark Souls)</li>
  <li>GSC Game World (Stalker Series)
  <li>Amazon</li>
  <li>Netflix</li>
  <li>Teavanna</li>
  <li>The Home Depot*</li>
  <li>Synology</li>
  <li>Toyota</li>
  <li>Brother (for printers)</li>
</ol>

* - I've given them about $2000 for basement work and home maintenance, so I figure that's loyalty somehow.
