On the Friday of the Israel trip we took an all-day tour of Jerusalem, the capital city. Herein I'll share some of the sites we saw and the pictures we took.

Scrolls of Fire

A monument outside of Jerusalem chronicling the restoration of the Jewish state.

Tomb of Mary

A site outside of Jerusalem where Mary was buried.

Other Sites

Other locales in and other of the city.

Way of the Cross

The path Jesus carried the cross the site he was to die at. There are 14 "stations", where a significant event in the last moments of Jesus' life occurred. Every day there is a procession starting at 2:30pm that goes from start to finish.

The Holy Sepulchre

The Tomb of Christ
