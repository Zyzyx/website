A few weeks ago I attended FUDCon, the Fedora Users and Developers Conference. This year it took place in Tempe, Arizona at the Arizona State University.

At Red Hat my primary job function is to be the Release Engineer for the company's Cloud and Virtualization products and efforts. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux images in Amazon's EC2 were built by me using tools I wrote internally. Much of the work I've done has been made public and available to the Fedora community, but there is still a lot of work to do: the work to integrate my tools with Fedora's infrastructure and release process is still on going. My purpose at FUDCon was to sync with stakeholders in Fedora-land and consult as needed for this effort.

Thus I had a list of people at FUDCon I wanted to meet and talk with, but the first half of the convention involves talks and presentations, and they were fantastic this year around. The convention uses the "barcamp" style of presenting: anyone interested in giving a talk (whether they've prepared in advance or not) pitches their subject in 15 seconds. More than 40 people did this. Then, attendees vote on which talks they would be interested in. Finally, a schedule is computed, and folks go where they want.

Initially I was surprised to find out the convention is rather small: a little over 200 people attended. There were no vendors or indications of a trade show at all, this is for Users and Developers only. I was very impressed with the content at the talks though, those alone made the trip worth it.

The second half of the convention is composed of "hackfests", which are basically impromptu meetings that attendees are encouraged to arrange themselves. The content can be anything; this is basically how the user community connects with developers more personally and interact as needed. This may involve busting out prototype code and services, or just talking over a coffee. I spent most of this time talking with Fedora Release Engineering, the Anaconda team, and other parties interested in EC2, such as the Cloud SIG. I got through my list of people I needed to sync with by the end of Sunday, including a dinner. Monday more hackfests were going on, we basically rent out a bunch of ASU classrooms as needed, and I just hung out at a few as an observer.

Notable people I met by IRC nick in no particular order:

* dgilmore - Fedora Rel-Eng
* jkeating - Former Fedora Rel-Eng
* jforbes - Guy responsible for producting Fedora cloud images
* The Anaconda Team
* skvidal - Yum author
* gepetto - Yum/RPM maintainer
* mmcgrath - Fedora Infrastructure lead

Definitely worth the trip, even though Manchester's winter weather kept me an extra day. It was really cool meeting people behind the email address or IRC nicks that I've been working with for the past few months. It's a wonderful feeling being approached and addressed by random people that others have directed to you. There were also many career-growth opportunities laid out too, many upstream projects need help and are more willing to accept work after they've met you in person. Would do again.
