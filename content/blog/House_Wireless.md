With a new house comes a new wireless network. We've been frustrated with the [Linksys WRT160N v2](http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-WRT160N-Wireless-N-Broadband-Router/dp/B000Z3U1P6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1330484855&sr=1-1) we bought off the shelf at Best Buy. Once or twice every month Muffin would have to reset it to connect to the wireless (I blame Vista) and you could not install any custom firmware on it.

This time I did far more research, and landed with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RT-N16-Wireless-N-Maximum-Performance-single/dp/B00387G6R8">Asus NT-16</a>. I had been looking to find a router that fully supported <a href="http://tomatousb.org/">TomatoUSB</a>, open source router firmware that was recommended by a few coworkers. I was initially put off by the "Gaming Router" part of the name, but the feature list of the hardware, rather than the software (which I would be replacing) is what sold me. With Tomato on this thing I can:

<ul>
  <li>Set up VLANs. The interesting corollary that I could connect a wireless access point to a VLAN'd port, and essentially provide additional wireless networks, such as a guest SSID.</li>
  <li>Share USB storage. I could set up an FTP server, SAMBA share, or DLNA service to share out the content on it too. That means (in theory, I haven't tested) that I can have the Xbox 360 play media from it.</li>
  <li>Set up very detailed QOS settings; prevent BitTorrent from dominating the network.</li>
</ul>

There's a lot more, but those are the big things I liked. The purchase is pretty recent, so I cannot comment on the longevity yet. But so far, I'm very happy with getting this feature set from $90 hardware. Hooray free software!
