I've noticed something about game-related websites lately: the trend of making the site more friendly to mobile device browsers at the expense of traditional computers. I don't begrudge device owners; I browse on my phone too when I really need to, but I don't own an iPad. It is not, nor will it be for a long time, a practical use of my time. I have no problem if you own one to play Angry Birds.

Months ago I was a frequent reader of Kotaku, mostly because of the layout and simple design. Now though, the site is driven by a lot of web technologies that are friendly to mobile devices, but not so much for traditional browsers. Even today, months after the redesign, the site runs like ass on two different operating systems on two different computers I own. If you're a first timer to the site, you only see ONE article on the front page. Actually, many Gawker-owned sites run like shit. Maybe that's the problem.

Oh wait, there's Shacknews, another offender. Recently they went with redesign that features huge tiles on their front page to make it easier for one to poke with their fingers. What happened to the list of headlines so I could quickly scan for interesting content? Actually, if you have ads enabled, there is one insidious tile (same size and all) that is actually an ad on the right hand side. Of course, the forums/comments sections were loud with complaints, but so far they've been ignored. Nice fucking job, Shacknews. Bookmark removed.

Lastly, there's The Escapist. The link comes later because I have to explain something first. More than a year ago, that site prided itself on having a "magazine" like flair to it. (You'll note when you visit the site that "magazine" is still in the URL) It was meant for gamers that understood the value of good writing, and were willing to spend extra time with the site. The flow was you would come to the site when a new issue came out, and then flip a page at a time reading the content. I came to this site when I didn't want quick reviews, but rather thoughtful and pointful editorials and observations.

Evidently that wasn't very profitable, because now they do the complete opposite. Just look at this shit show. My eyes don't even know where to look first. It's just a wall of ads and pictures. The quality of the content has really plunged too, with the notable exception of Zero Punctuation. Compare any of his videos with this cunt. I swear ZP is the only reason that site got popular.

Do the majority of gamers really view websites on phones and ipads? I really don't understand the trend. I recognize the interest, and maybe someday I'll have mobile.brolem.net, but I'm not going to redesign the site and make it more difficult to computer users. That's just lazy.

Fuck the escapist, seriously. Fuck that site in the ass. I refuse to even capitalize the name any more. The audience of that site is exactly why I never get involved with navel-gazing gamer communities, never go to gamer conventions, never want a job as a game developer, because so many of them are that god damn stupid.

Can you imagine what it must be like to work 80 hour weeks for months, finish a game only to have parades of 14 year old 360 players cum all over each other while they watch that skank review their game? Or have to peruse their own forums and read a comment from some pink-polo-shirt wearing fuckpot that started playing games a year ago that thinks it inexplicably deserves a 7/10?

I would kill myself. I would kill myself so hard in front of that guy. I would sneak into their house and eat myself to death with nothing but garlic baked beans, because that would be a motherfucker to clean up. I would leave a note that "said everything you touch turns to shit".

What was I talking about again? Oh yeah site redesigns for mobile devices at the expense of usability for PC users make me sad. Fuck the escapist.
