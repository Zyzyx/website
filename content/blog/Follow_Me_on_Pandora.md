I wasn't aware of the extent of [Pandora Radio](http://pandora.com) had developed the social media part of their website until recently. Yesterday the Wife and I caught dinner at <a href="http://www.teatroboston.com/#/home">Teatro</a> before catching a show in Boston, and they had a badass selection of chill break-beat pieces playing in the dining hall. I asked the hostess what was playing, and she replied they had found a Pandora station called "The Dining Rooms". 

Turns out <a href="http://www.thediningrooms.org/">The Dining Rooms is an artist</a>, and a user had seeded their station with that artist and been sharing it. I found it moments ago too, at least I think I did... of 7 pieces played, 3 of them I'm fairly certain I heard last night.

After a little deeper exploration of the Pandora website, I decided to make my Pandora profile public and re-arranged a few of my stations into more cohesive selections instead of random lists of thumbed-up songs. I have shared those as well. You can find my profile and stations <a href="http://www.pandora.com/#!/profile/activity/brolem">here</a> and even add them to your list if you want. Feel free to "follow" me and let me know if you're sharing a profile too.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.brolem.net/brolem/node/808">Mogg's post</a> that motivated me to find a better way to share what I'm listening to.
