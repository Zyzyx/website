Another day down.

Talks attended:

    (***  )Breaking the Unbreakable Oracle: New auxiliary module for metasploit to automate breaking into Oracle databases, and granting a given user DBA privs.
    (**** )Using Guided Missiles in Drive-bys: -1 for the title being misleading. This talk about fingerprinting a browser and launching targeted exploits (via metasploit) was pretty interesting.
    (**   )Security risks of Web 2.0: Broad overview kind of thing, not too technical. My interest was to see if this site had any flaws I should know about, but that expectation was not met.
    (**** )Failure: An interesting talk given by Adam Savage, of Mythbusters fame. Collected his autograph on my DefCon program.
    (***  )Hijacking Web 2.0 Sites with SSLstrip: Entertaining but again nothing that I could have applied to this site.

    I may have to try some of what I've learned so far at home! Tonight for dinner we'll be meeting with a former Warcraft guildie who coincidentally is in Vegas for his 30th birthday. So far I've always had lots of fun meeting people IRL that I met in game. I haven't played since April so I'm looking forward to hear how he thinks the game is doing.
