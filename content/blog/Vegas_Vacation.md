The last 5 days I have been in Las Vegas, and it is good to be home again. Originally the plan was [David](http://blog.burdell.org/) <a href="https://plus.google.com/110197054476722784567/about">Cantrell</a> and I would attend <a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-index.html">DefCon 20</a> together, but then our wives wanted to come, and naturally <a href="http://www.bangmoney.org/serendipity/index.php">Chris Lumens</a> and his wife found good reasons to be there too: hiking in the mountains. DefCon only lasted 3 days, but we made a group vacation out of it by adding a couple more.

Friday morning we flew in and I got registered in short order. There was a lot more collateral this year than before: a DefCon music CD, a DVD of the talks, movies, and archives of previous conventions' material. The badge this year was the most complex and expensive yet. The talks I attended were:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Soghoian">Can you track me now?</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Miller">NFC Attack Surface Analysis</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Lee">Attacking NFC the Easy Way</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Minozhenko">Hacking VMWare vCenter in 60 Seconds</a></li>
</ul>

As usual there were a bunch of vendors around, the lockpicking village and various contests. I spent a little time visiting those before heading out for the evening and rejoining the group. We had a show to attend: <a href="http://www.excalibur.com/entertainment/tournament_of_kings.aspx/">Tournament of Kings</a>. It certainly was entertaining and filling, but I think the performance by <a href="http://www.medievaltimes.com/">Medieval Times</a> was better. This one was more kid-friendly, and clearly scripted. I know the other one is too, but one did not do as well masking that. We retired to our room at <a href="http://www.luxor.com/">the Luxor</a> afterward, blaming the 5.5 hour airplane trip for knocking us out.

At 5am a hooker knocked on our door looking for work.

Saturday was another full day of DefCon and evening shows:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Marlinspike">Defeating PPTP VPNs and WPA Enterprise</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Alonso">Javascript Botnets</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Cannon">Into the Droid</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Griffin">Hacking Measured Boot and UEFI</a></li>
</ul>

After the talks I watched the CTF ("binjitsu 4") game for a while and won a t-shirt by answering an impromptu trivia question correctly. We attended <a href="http://recycledpercussionband.com/">Recycled Percussion</a> which was loud but entertaining. Liz and I saw <a href="http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/Shows/LeReve/Photos">La Reve</a> after that, which is probably the best acrobatic show I've ever seen, better than Cirque du Soleil's "O". Following that was a night of drinking and gambling, until midnight.

Sunday once again David and I met at 8am at a Starbucks and headed out. In the midst of the talks he stopped at the Hardware Hacking Village and soldered his badge pieces together. I still have to do this.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Bryner">Kinectasploit v2</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Coppola">Router Rootkits</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#FX">Hacking [redacted] Routers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Bursztein">Fuzzing Online Games</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Etemadieh">Hacking GoogleTV</a></li>
</ul>

That evening we <a href="https://plus.google.com/110197054476722784567/posts/GxTS7FsuqvH">stuffed ourselves silly</a> at some "Buca" restaurant. (I forget the real name) It hurt walking back to the hotel. Some more gambling and shenanigans occured which ended with a late night watching of a re-run of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Eat_Dog_%28U.S._game_show%29">Dog Eat Dog</a> with the Lumens where we got good and angry mocking it and feeling dumber by the minute.

Monday the convention was over, but the vacation was not. The Cantrells and I (Liz had to fly home to go back to work) toured the Hoover Dam, and took the Dam(n) Tour. I'll have to post pictures at some point, the interior of that place is right out of Stalker. In the evening we hit the Bellagio buffet, once against succumbing to gluttony and staggered back to the hotel where we gambled together. I had to call my wife to transfer more money to our bank accounts and refiance the house. Ok, that's an exaggeration but I did lose $250. Hooray Vegas!

We'll have to do it again next year. (a Vegas/DefCon trip, not losing money)
