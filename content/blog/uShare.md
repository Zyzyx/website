Illinoise inspired me while I was home for the holidays: via TVersity he is able to play media from his desktop that is sitting in his room upstairs on his PS3. I wanted to do something similar, but TVersity is Windows-only which is unacceptable. I did get uShare working on mine though, which provides a Universal Plug aNd Play server that xbox360s can identify on the network.

uShare is very lightweight, and like any good linux tool, console-driven. After installing I had it up and serving out The Fountain in literally seconds. I had to download an add-on for the 360 to allow it to play "unprotected" files (those without silly DRM). With this set up I don't have to bend over at Best Buy for a 25+ foot S-video cable, or bother hunting for a deal on Amazon. For just 10 minutes of my time: a little research, installation, and execution, I'm watching stuff on my computer on my TV in the living room. Fantastic.
