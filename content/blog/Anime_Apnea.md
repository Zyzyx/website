The wife has the Netflix account and does way more viewing than I do. Recently a few anime series were recommended that we watched together. The first was [Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6634), and then came <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=10154">Black Butler</a>. I won't got into summaries here, you can use the links for that. Instead I'll briefly explain what I liked and disliked.

Moribito is the type of anime I like, the target audience is meant to be mature and it spends a fair amount of time exploring the world they created. I liked how they tied history, setting, and religion together in this one. It does have 3 or 4 episodes of filler in the first season, so be ready for that. The was a plot hole or two as well that we found confusing. There's one part in particular where a character falls down a steep slope (almost a cliff) and the pursuers are like "well, we can't go down there" and just turn around and leave.

Black Butler I had a hard time staying with. It has a lot of the Sailor Moon style mannerisms with 2 frames of animation, a lot of high pitched female yapping, and large emotional icons like blue drips and red throbbing veins. They really club you over the head with some of the character's devotions too, which is exacerbated when you watch the episodes back to back. It was entertaining though.
