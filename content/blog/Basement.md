My [basement](https://plus.google.com/100173933959110516752/posts/jBDFcitRQaz) is almost finished, and if you're cool enough to be on G+ you can see the pictures with the link. 

The project started in late April, and will be finished this week. It cost about $9,000 from start to finish. I hired contractors twice: once for mudding, and again for finishing the stairs. For muddling I just didn't want to spend the time on it, and the carpentry work for the stairs (including the banister and laying the carpet down) was beyond my ability learn on the fly. 

So far, I'm pretty happy with the results. The couches came in Friday, there isn't much else to be done now. It sounds great and looks great; I'm looking forward to playing horror games with you guys!
