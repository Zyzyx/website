This weekend Muffin and I moved to our new apartment. We just finished unpacking the bedroom accessories and living room. Unfortunately, we won't have an internet connection until Friday. This makes my evenings very boring.

Usually, this is the time to hijack a neighbor's unsecured wireless network, but when it comes to working from home or doing a little online banking, I'm not really comfortable using someone else's connection. It could turn out they'd be someone like me.

Last night I investigated and tried tethering my smart phone. Tethering basically means turning your smart phone into a wireless router. Clients (like the laptop I'm typing this on) connect to it like any other wireless network, but the internet content is coming in from the 2/3/4G network. Now whenever I have my phone on me, I have an internet connection. I'm tempted to call and tell Comcast to shove off, but I can't leave my phone at home at all times for when Muffin needs the internet, unfortunately.

So far it is not against the terms of service to tether, but that could change in the future. Users are discouraged to over-utilize the cell network; it's not a good idea to download 40 gigs content from your phone. The network really isn't meant for that, and it also sends up red flags to the carrier. I would guess the more red flags they see, the sooner they'll crack down.

Tethering your phone has been made quite easy after step one: rooting it. It also requires a netfilter-enabled kernel. Droid Incredibles (which are android 2.2 based) have that already, but if you don't you'll need to install a custom one. Once that is done, you just have to download the Tethering app from the marketplace.
