Turns out I have a free night tonight so I can finally put down a few posts that I've been meaning to get to for several days.

I'll start with a review of Machinarium. This is, literally, a point-and-click adventure game written in Flash. P-n-C games were popular in the early nineties, you rarely see these at all any more with today's graphics but this one was surprisingly good. It's only $10 that you can download from their site easily (and legitimately).

All of the artwork is hand-drawn, and has an Invader-Zim feel to it in some ways. The puzzles, except for 1 in particular, (maybe it's just me) were intuitive and thoughtful, but not trivially solvable. There is no dialog at all; all communication comes in the form of charming cartoons in thought-bubbles from the robots' heads. There are about 10-12 hours of game-play depending on how smart you are. There isn't much in the way of story, but it does resolve well enough at the end. The setting isn't really explained either, but it doesn't need to be: it's an alternative robot-world. Just explore it.

I do have to call out the music in particular for being really great. You can find samples here.

For only $10, it's hard to argue. I enjoyed it all the way through.
