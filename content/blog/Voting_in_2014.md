November 4th is a midterm election day here in the states, but it is not the presidential election day, so it often goes ignored by the American public. How is someone supposed to find time to research multiple candidates for multiple positions? The majority of the ads are negative and filled with exaggerations about how bad the other guy is, so this makes voter education very difficult. Granted, this isn't a good excuse, but it is common enough that it needs to be addressed somehow.

One thing candidates all have in common though: bribery. Well, that's what other countries call it. Americans use terms like "lobbying" and "campaign contributions" instead, but it is the same thing, just legalized. What if we had a way to track where the money is coming from? That seems like an effective way to figure out where a candidate really stands.

Consider the [Greenhouse add-on for Firefox and Chrome](http://allaregreen.us/), which mines the <a href="http://opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</a> databases and presents the results when you hover over a candidate's name. Be careful though, the add-on does sometimes cause javascript applications to hang, and increases page load times while it fetches information. I suggest only enabling it when you're doing research, not for everyday browsing.

Head on over to <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2014/Senate/senate_races.html">this page</a> to see a list of all running senate candidates per state. You'll have to click on homepages before the add-on will parse a name usually, since it does not parse links.

Let's vote a little smarter this year!
