I like Gin, it's my spirit of choice. Currently there are 7 different varieties in my cabinet.

For mixers (a drink where you add a soda or juice) where I don't need a high quality Gin, I usually go with [Bombay Sapphire](http://www.bombaysapphire.com/en-us/lda.aspx?redirect=year2-competition). It is a good quality Gin for sure, and in restaurants with a modest bar that's what I'll pick too.

For cocktails, it depends on the style I'm going for; there are 2 categories of Gin to consider: American and London-dry. The main difference between these two is the juniper profile. If the juniper berries are in your face, it's a London-Dry. Juniper sort of tastes like a pine tree, it's hard to describe if you have never had it. In Gin, it's the quality that gives it the characteristic medicinal or anti-septic taste and smell. If you're drinking band-aids, it's a London-Dry Gin. American Gin can be pretty eccletic. Hendrick's for example is infused with cucumber and rose petals after the distillation.

So back to cocktails, if I'm going for a classic martini sort of thing, I'll select <a href="http://www.bruichladdich.com/the-botanist-islay-dry-gin">the Botanist</a> or <a href="http://citadellegin.com">Citadelle</a>. Often I'll substitute the dry vermouth with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillet">Lillet Blanc</a>, which brings me something similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesper_%28cocktail%29">Vesper Martini</a>. This cocktail is for drinking with other gin drinkers, or when you're in one of those weddings where you feel compelled to out-dress the groom in a several-hundred dollar custom suit. Serious snobbery.

American gins I recommend are <a href="http://us.hendricksgin.com/">Hendriks</a> or <a href="http://berkshiremountaindistillers.com/our-products/ethereal-gin-limited-edition/">Berkshire Ethereal</a>. Hendriks really has a bright and refreshing taste that belongs in summer months. It goes great with tonic or club soda and limes. Berkshire distillery changes up their distillation recipe every 6 months or so, and they've been consistently good. If you want to play the hipster/obscurity card, go with this one.

On a couple occasions I confess I have been asked to man a bar for someone else's party. I will usually go to the place with 3 or 4 decanters filled with pre-mixed cocktails, and then experiment on the fly for anyone feeling adventurous. The best cocktail I have come up with on the fly ironically does not include any gin, I have not found a cocktail that all of my non-gin drinking friends enjoy immediately. The ingredients are Bourbon, Benedictine, Tuaca, St. Elizabeth's All-spice Dram, and bitters. The Dram is hard to find, but if you ever see me at a party with it, ask for a Snowbird.
